  \#5NewThings
============

The Water Resources Mission Area is spotlighting five newly available
features on our [next-gen](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-tng/)
monitoring location pages this week! To compliment this blog post, we
will show off our work on Instagram and Twitter, using the hashtag
\#5NewThings. These improvements showcase our adoption of modern web
technologies as we update our data delivery paradigm.

\#1 Flood benchmarks 
--------------------

The next-gen monitoring location pages now show flood benchmarks on the
hydrographs. These benchmarks allow users to understand how the current
gage height relates to the risk of potential flooding. The flood
categories used by the National Weather Service (NWS) are defined
[here](https://www.weather.gov/aprfc/terminology).

**Action Stage** - the stage which, when reached by a rising stream,
represents the level where the NWS or a partner/user needs to take some
type of mitigation action in preparation for possible significant
hydrologic activity.

**Flood Stage** - an established gage height for a given location above
which a rise in water surface level begins to create a hazard to lives,
property, or commerce. The issuance of **flood advisories** or
**warnings** is linked to flood stage.

**Moderate Flooding **is defined to have some inundation of structures
and roads near the stream. Some evacuations of people and/or transfer of
property to higher elevations may be necessary. A **flood
warning** should be issued if moderate flooding is expected during the
event. In remote areas with few specific impacts, floods with 15-40 year
recurrence interval would be assumed to be causing moderate flooding on
streams in the area.

**Major Flooding **is defined to have extensive inundation of structures
and roads. Significant evacuations of people and/or transfer of property
to higher elevations are necessary. A **flood warning** should be issued
if major flooding is expected during the event. In remote areas with few
specific impacts, floods with 50-100 year recurrence interval would be
assumed to be causing major flooding on streams in the area.

\#2 State of hydrograph for bookmarking and linking
---------------------------------------------------

The next-gen monitoring location pages serve a huge range of users from
kayakers to emergency managers. Users are now able to bookmark and share
a hydrograph in the way that they requested it. Users can share custom
hydrographs generated with specific time-series statistics, parameter
codes, dates, and compare settings. For example, a user may be
interested in the changes in gage height at the [USGS gage Colorado
River at Lee\'s Ferry,
AZ](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09380000/) over the
course of the November 2012 [Glen Canyon Dam High Flow Experimental
Release](https://www.usbr.gov/uc/rm/gcdHFE/index.html). After choosing a
custom time range and the gage height parameter, the [URL in the browser
can be used to share or return to the same
settings](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09380000/#parameterCode=00065&startDT=2012-11-01&endDT=2012-12-01).

\#3 NLDI (The Hydro Network-Linked Data Index)
----------------------------------------------

By utilizing the Hydro Network-Linked Data Index
([NLDI](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nldi-intro/)), monitoring
locations can be put into the context of a catchment or basin. Each
active stream site has an upstream basin in NLDI, as you can see here:

    </div>

\#4 Brush & Zoom

The brush and zoom capability allows the user to easily select any part
of the hydrograph for closer examination. On the lower hydrograph, the
user simply clicks on the brush handles and drags them to the desired
timeframe. The upper hydrograph reflects the new time selection. The
handles are big enough for use on mobile devices.

\#5 Table of hydrograph data 
----------------------------

A frequent request that comes into our user [feedback
email](mailto:WDFN@usgs.gov) box concerns the availability of the
underlying hydrograph data. Now users can explore the data behind
the graph by using the 'Table of hydrograph data' feature on
the next-gen monitoring location pages. One click expands the table for
a detailed view of the data behind the hydrograph.
