Current users of Legacy WaterAlert will be able to take 3 simple steps to transfer their alerts to the Next Generation system. <b>Users should have received an email from us with a unique link to the transition page for their specific alerts.</b> YOU MUST CLICK THE LINK IN YOUR EMAIL TO TRANSITION. We anticipate this process taking 5 minutes or less for most users.
<i>Users who do not transition following that first email will continue to receive emails until they either transition, or until the transition period closes.</i>

<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/WaterAlert/Card2_3 easy steps_updated.png" width="60%" caption="Users will take 3 simple steps to transition to NextGen WaterAlert: login, transfer alerts, verify they're all there, and you're done! " alt="graphic with text: 3 easy steps, 1 login, 2 transfer alerts, 3 verify!" >}}
</div>



## Step 1: Login

<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/WaterAlert/Card3_Step 1_ Login.png" width="60%" alt="graphic with text: Next Generation WaterAlert, transition your legacy alerts now!" >}}
</div>

Public users will use [login.gov](https://login.gov/), the public's one account for government services. If you don't have a login.gov account, it takes only a few minutes and 3 pieces of information to [create an account](https://login.gov/create-an-account/). You'll need your email address, a secure password, and one or more authentication methods. 

USGS users will use their active directory credentials to seamlessly login to WaterAlert with one click.

## Step 2: Transfer alerts
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/WaterAlert/Card4_Step 2_ Transfer alerts.png" width="60%" alt="graphic with text: Next Generation WaterAlert, transition your legacy alerts now!" >}}
</div>

Choose which alerts to transfer to NextGen WaterAlert. When in doubt, <b>select all</b> since you won't be able to return to this transition page.

## Step 3: Verify
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/WaterAlert/Step 3_ Verify.png" width="60%" alt="graphic with text: Next Generation WaterAlert, transition your legacy alerts now!" >}}
</div>

Youâ€™re all done. Click <b>My Alerts</b> to verify that your alerts transitioned successfully. From here, you can edit, delete, and pause existing alerts, and create new alerts.
