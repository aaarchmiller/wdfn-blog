## Groundwater-Level Observations Affected by Dry, Flowing, Frozen, Obstructed, and Pumping Conditions

In February 2021, USGS Water started serving groundwater-level data in a
way that deviated from how we had in the past. Due to a change in our
software, we began publishing some groundwater observations in a new
way. This affected many of our products and our users. Our users had to
change their workflows and they found the data presentation inaccurate.
Products such as [Groundwater
Watch](https://groundwaterwatch.usgs.gov/) experienced shifts in statistics.

Based on feedback and a careful review, we have made changes to the way
these observations are published so our data are clearly interpreted.
The purpose of this blog post is to help explain the process we went
through over about a year, resulting in **essentially returning to
the pre-2021 way of publishing groundwater-level observations affected
by dry, flowing, frozen, obstructed, and pumping conditions.**

## Which observations were affected?

The groundwater observations most affected by our 2021 changes were
those relatively rare ones where hydrographers attempt to make a
measurement of the groundwater level in a well and cannot because the
well is dry, water is flowing out of the top of the well, water is
frozen inside the well, or an obstruction in the well prevents the
instrument from reaching water. In these instances, it is important for
users to know the site was visited, but the groundwater level could not
be measured successfully.

Due to snowy terrain, Pomerleau used a utility terrain vehicle (UTV) to access the well, requiring a trek of about 15 miles from the main road. Data from this groundwater site '[443647070552303](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/443647070552303/)' Middle Dam, Maine, can be viewed at the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) web site.

</div>


Additional groundwater observations affected by our 2021 changes were
groundwater-level measurements known to be affected by active pumping,
either in or nearby the well that is being measured. In this instance,
we make a successful measurement and obtain a publishable data value but
must ensure people understand this observation does not reflect the
static groundwater level.

## How data were changed

As part of a major software transition that we completed in 2021, we
changed how these affected observations were published in tables and on
graphs on the Web. Before the transition, the observations had a
descriptive qualifier (e.g. "dry" or "obstructed"), but no numeric data
value. After the transition, the observations had a vague qualifier
("true value is below reported value due to local conditions" or "true
value is above reported value due to local conditions") and an estimated
numeric data value derived from well construction, measuring point, or
depth of blockage information. For example, an observation of a dry well
was reported as the numeric value of the bottom of the well casing and
qualified as "the true value is below this reported value."

These numeric data values appeared on hydrographs on both legacy and
next-generation monitoring location pages in way that confused users.
Figure 3 shows an example of a well that was frequently dry. The dry
well observations started appearing as if they had measured numeric data
values; for example, observations of a dry well appeared as if they were
actual observed groundwater-level measurements at the bottom of the
well.

## Users told us the change was confusing

After we changed how these observations appeared, users told us they
didn't like this change. The change we made equated estimated data with
measured data, which was a problem for users. Users felt confusion
because we were assigning a numeric value when it shouldn't have been
there. In order to know the value was estimated, users would have had to
consider the associated qualifier code.

Users said they didn't understand the data as presented and were
concerned about the validity of these data. We talked to groundwater
users to understand how this was confusing, and how our data affect
their workflows. Some users were confused by the wording of the
qualifier code, while others stated that it would be challenging to
defend these confusing data values in legal cases. We learned that the
descriptive qualifiers indicating well conditions that were used prior
to the transition are important to some of our users.

We recognize this affected our users in a much larger way than we had
anticipated. We are committed to responding to our users' needs and are
grateful that our users pointed out their concerns and issues with this
data delivery.

## How we fixed this

To address user concerns, we changed our published groundwater levels
back to a way that is more consistent with how we historically have
served these data. **Observations of dry, flowing, frozen, or obstructed
wells are no longer reported as qualified numeric data values.**
Instead, they are reported with a clearly descriptive qualifier (dry,
flowing, frozen, or obstructed), and there is no numeric data value
reported. We still publish numeric data values at wells affected by
pumping (as we have all along), but we are showing the descriptive
qualifier "pumping" associated with these data values rather than the
vague qualifier "true value is above reported value due to local
conditions"---users must clearly understand when active pumping affects
our observations.

The data display now reflects that a field visit was made to a site
along with any qualifiers needed to indicate conditions at the time of
observation that either prevented a measurement or may have affected the
measurement and numeric data value obtained. These changes are now
apparent in tables and in hydrographs. These changes are reflected
throughout our system, and now statistics and long-term trends have been
amended to contain these data.
