# Join our [Teams Live Event](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_OGU4YzcyYmUtMzcyMS00YTVhLWFmOTQtODIyZjE3ZTM3Y2Mz%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2274c01c76-7d2c-4555-94ec-9e22ecb44037%22%2c%22IsBroadcastMeeting%22%3atrue%7d&btype=a&role=a) on Oct, 13th at 1 pm EDT/ 10 am PDT to learn about how we’re modernizing the way we display water data online.

Access to water data is crucial for decision-making, and you can do amazing things with (@USGS_Water](https://twitter.com/USGS_water) data. But, our previous system didn't make data access easy, so we’re [rebuilding our data delivery system](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/realtime-pages-replacement/). 

## To hear more of the story, watch our brief introduction video, available on [our website](https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/introduction-water-data-nations-next-generation-monitoring) or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0UnEH1l-Yg).

At USGS, we know how important it is for crucial water data to be accessible, usable, and discoverable for all American citizens. We’d like to tell you all about how we’re prioritizing better data delivery so you have the information you need to make important decisions.  

## Join the conversation – attend our public webinar on October 13th, 2021 @ 1pm EDT/ 10am PDT.
