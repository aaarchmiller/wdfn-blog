What are you decommissioning? 
===========
As the USGS Water Mission Area (WMA) undertakes modernizing data
delivery as part of implementation of the U.S. Geological Survey Water
Science Strategy ([Circular 1382-G](<https://doi.org/10.3133/cir1383G>)),
resources will be directed away from legacy applications to new
development and delivery mechanisms. In 2020, several WMA web
applications are reaching end-of-life, are subject to critical
vulnerabilities, and/or are subject to increased licensing fees. The
National Water Census Data Portal has reached end-of-life and will be
shut down (decommissioned) in the immediate future.

National Water Census -- Data Portal (NWC-DP) Application
===========
NWC-DP provides national estimates of water budget components for local
watersheds, water withdrawal data for counties, tools to calculate
statistics of daily streamflow records, modeled daily streamflow at
ungaged stations, and access to records of aquatic biology observations.
The portal is a subset of the research and information being conducted
by the National Water Census.

What is the timeline? 
===========
The [Portal](<https://cida.usgs.gov/nwc/>) will be decommissioned on September 1,
2020. 


Where can I find the data after the application is turned off? 
===========
Continued, long term access to National Water Census - Data Portal
application data will be provided via alternative data repositories such
as [Science Base](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52a7ba64e4b0de1a6d2dd0fb) and
[NWISWeb]([https://waterdata.usgs.gov](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/)).
