The USGS has published water data on the World Wide Web 
[since 1995](/25-years-of-water-data-on-the-web/).  Millions of people use our websites to 
[check the status](/user_check_status/) of current water conditions or 
[explore for water data and download](/user_explore_download/) the data they need.  A 
[smaller group of users](/user_operational_pull/) are interested in 
integrating USGS water data into their own software or ongoing workflows.  **If you're someone who wants to incorporate
water data into your own application or website, our web-based water-data Application Programming Interfaces 
(APIs) are for you.**

This is a high-level cataloging of our most prominent USGS water-data web-based APIs and endpoints.  The groupings 
are designed to guide new users to our best and newest flagship APIs that adopt open standards of the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC).  These groupings also should help existing users understand the wider context for the APIs they 
already use (and to perhaps consider some new ones).

For purposes of this article we define the following conventions:[^semantics]
- *API.*  A collection of web services whose input parameters and output formats are
well-documented, allowing systems to integrate USGS water data.  Output formats always can be
some open-standard format, but input parameters may or may not conform to an open standard.
- *Endpoint.*  A Web URL that accepts input parameters and outputs data in some machine-friendly format (_i.e.,_ not HTML).
Input parameters and output formats are not necessarily well-documented.  The most basic way to
provide water data on the Web, it was not designed to be an automated API.


| Icon | Significance |
|------|--------------|
|üöÄ | Newer, flagship APIs you should consider using preferentially. | 
|üë©‚Äçüî¨ | Beta experimental APIs from [USGS Water Data Labs](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/).  Please try them, but please understand they may change. |
|üï∏ | Legacy APIs or endpoints, stable and long in production.  Continue to use for now, but be warned eventually they may be decommissioned. |
|üõë | Deprecated or decommissioned APIs and endpoints.  Do not use these anymore. |

Want the latest real-time water data from a river, groundwater well, or other USGS monitoring location?  This is 
your newest open-standard way to do that.  SensorThings is being designed to help usher in the 
Internet of Things.  It is a simple-to-understand API that encourages software developers to use it in their 
applications (previous open standards like WaterML were thorough and meticulous, but tedious to parse 
to extract the actual data itself).  

**Endpoint for our beta OGC SensorThings API implementation: https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/sta/v1.1/**

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

Want to try out our SensorThings API?  We hope to release an example Python Notebook by Spring 2022, so you can
try it out for yourself.  In the meantime, here's a super-quick way to dive into it:
1. Make a web request for one of the
[_things_](https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/sensorthingsapi/requestingData/STA-Data-Model.html)
(our _things_ are USGS monitoring locations).  For example,
[here is the _thing_ for Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/sta/v1.1/Things('USGS-09380000')).
1. Inside the JSON structure[^jsonview] returned for a _thing_ in (1) are elements containing additional URLs that can be opened
to obtain data for this station. Find the element named ```Datastreams@iot.navigationLink``` and open the URL in this
property to see 
[datastreams associated with this _thing_](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/sta/v1.1/Things('USGS-09380000')/Datastreams).
1. The URL in (2) returns an array of recent time-series data available for this station.  Each object in the array
has a ```description``` element describing the time series, as well as a ```properties``` element that contains
a ```ParameterCode``` element describing the time series with a 5-digit
[USGS parameter code](https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/parameters)
(_e.g.,_ 00060 signifies Discharge and 00065 signifies Gage Height).[^pcodeymmv]  
1. Following the ```Observations@iot.navigationLink``` 
element's URL will start returning the data of interest.

A majority of data collected and exchanged in the world today has a _geographic location_ as a core
attribute.  USGS water data is no exception! So we're adopting the 
[OGC API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) as a flagship API.
Our implementation of OGC API offers detailed metadata about multiple stations for easy map 
plotting, and offers certain limited forms of water data.  We've only just begun to use this API 
and we plan to expand our use of it considerably, particularly as OGC API continues 
to evolve.  Presently we implement its foundational 
[Part 1: Features-Core](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/). 

**Endpoint for our beta OGC API implementation: https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/collections/**

<h3> Getting Started</h3>

Want to try out our OGC API?  We are considering what developer-friendly materials we can provide and suggestions
on client software libraries you might consider.  Please check back and also look for other blog posts.
In the meantime, here's a super-quick way to dive into it:
1. Make a web request for the 
[Active Groundwater Level collection](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/collections/AGL?f=json).  
1. The response provides an overview of this network of USGS monitoring locations, which are modeled as _features_
in a _collection_.  The features themselves in this collection (_i.e.,_ the monitoring locations in this network) can be seen
[here](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/collections/AGL/items?f=json).  
1. The ```properties``` elements within this response contain helpful monitoring location metadata.
1. More information about any one of these features is available at a more specific URL (_e.g.,_ 
[here is the USGS Winslow, Arizona I-40 well](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/collections/AGL/items/USGS-350002110355501?f=json)).
1. Digging one level deeper into the observations associated with any feature may offer certain forms of water data we have 
begun to populate in this API (_e.g.,_ 
[the Winslow I-40 well's observations](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/collections/AGL/items/USGS-350002110355501/observations?f=json)
include daily-values and discrete groundwater levels).

You also might like the 
[provisional Swagger Documentation](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/observations/swagger-ui/index.html?url=%2Fapi%2Fobservations%2Fv3%2Fapi-docs)

<!--- WATER QUALITY PORTAL ACCORDION SECTION START -->
<h2 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="a3">
üöÄ Water Quality Portal <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h2>
<div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Interested in water quality and the laboratory analyses that inform us about the quality of the nation's 
water?  Then the flagship Water Quality Portal is for you.  It is a joint endeavor among 
several government agencies that collect these types of data; you can obtain data from the USGS and also other 
government organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency.

Discrete water-quality data are inherently richer, more complex, and challenging to interpret than 
time-series data.  Accordingly, the primary output format is the relatively complex 
[Water Quality eXchange (WQX)](https://exchangenetwork.net/data-exchange/wqx/) open standard. But
fret not!  The Water Quality Portal also supports the 
[OGC Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms) open-standard API to 
easily get dots put on map tiles and thus on interactive maps.  Even though the underlying data are
complex and rich in structure, support of WMS allows a low barrier to entry to begin exploring the 
spatial distribution of these data.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

**Read our [documentation for the portal's API](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation/).**  It's
about a 15-minute read and should let you begin to understand basic functionality.
Or get started even faster by **[interactively building a search](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/);** after the query is 
built using the advanced form, the website will give you code you can embed directly into your application.

<span class="usa-tag">NOTE</span> WQX data are output in a long format, which has the benefit of 
creating a standard, pre-defined number of fields that convey important metadata.  The 
downside of this format is that is splits up individual measurements or results for a particular 
sampling event.  However, there are many tools available to help reformat WQX data for 
ease of analysis.  In fact, the USGS has created and maintains the 
[R package dataRetrieval](/dataretrieval), which can issue necessary API calls *and* facilitate conversion of
the resulting dataset into formats more friendly for immediate use.

</div>


<!--- NLDI ACCORDION SECTION START -->
<h2 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="a4">
üöÄ Hydro Network Linked Data Index (NLDI) API <!--- üöÄ -->
</button></h2>
<div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The NLDI allows your application to programmatically "swim" up and down the river and stream network of the United 
States, discovering USGS monitoring locations along the way.  It also returns shapes that define watershed 
boundaries.  The output format is GeoJSON, making it easy to integrate into web-based maps.
Essentially, it is a web-based API we have placed in front of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).

NLDI conveys the _relationships_ between a USGS monitoring location and waterbodies.  It also conveys how individual parts
of the river and stream network are connected to form the overall national river and stream network.  NLDI is, therefore, 
a form of water metadata.  For the actual quantitative water data itself, use other APIs like SensorThings and OGC API.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

The best way to understand NLDI is to **[read its overview documentation](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/about-nldi/index.html)**.
Another helpful starting point can be [this overview blog post](/nldi-intro/).

Through some light reverse engineering[^pleasesteal] of [a USGS monitoring location page](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09380000/)
courtesy of a browser's network-debugger tool (usually the F12 key), we can observe the function calls these pages make to the NLDI API.  Other
NLDI API calls are possible, but it may be instructive to inspect these:
1. [Upstream flowlines.](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/nldi/linked-data/nwissite/USGS-09380000/navigation/UM/flowlines?f=json&distance=322)  A
GeoJSON LineString representing the river upstream of the station.  The distance parameter limits draw distance to 322 kilometers for performance 
reasons on Monitoring Location Pages, but draw distances up to 10,000 kilometers may be specified.
1. [Downstream flowlines.](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/nldi/linked-data/nwissite/USGS-09380000/navigation/DM/flowlines?f=json&distance=322) Same
as the upstream query, but in a downstream direction.
1. [Watershed catchment area.](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/nldi/linked-data/nwissite/USGS-09380000/basin?f=json) A GeoJSON MultiPolygon that
draws the watershed boundary upstream of this station.

<!--- HYDROGRAPH IMAGE ACCORDION SECTION START -->
<h2 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a5">
üë©‚Äçüî¨ Hydrograph Bitmap Image API<!--- üë©‚Äçüî¨‚öóüß™ -->
</button></h2>
<div id="a5" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The quickest way to integrate USGS time-series water data onto your own web page or into your own application may be
the simple process of embedding a 
[nifty bitmap image](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/) of a hydrograph.  It's a one-line addition to an HTML file!  Minimally all you need is 
the USGS monitoring location identifier (typically an 8-digit number).  The functionality is limited: you cannot customize
the bitmap image beyond the parameters we offer you, and the image is not interactive.  Still, this remains a popular, low-complexity
way to show your favorite river's recent streamflow or other measured data.

<h3> Getting Started </h3>

**Read our [documentation for this API](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/about-graph-image-api/).**  Or simply paste the following fragment
into your HTML, and modify the reasonably self-explanatory URL parameters to the right of the ```?``` as needed
([the result will look like this](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/api/graph-images/monitoring-location/09380000/?parameterCode=00060&width=640&title=true&period=P14D)):

<!--- LEGACY WEB API ACCORDION SECTION START -->
<h2 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a6">
üï∏ Legacy Web APIs Still Uniquely Valuable
</button></h2>
<div id="a6" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Around 2007 we launched a generation of APIs[^restful] that
output water data in an open-standard format known as [WaterML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/waterml).  For years, these 
were our prime API offerings for water data.  Although we are striving to phase these aging APIs out in favor of newer 
flagship APIs, they will yet be around for some time because existing client software already relies on them, and not all 
of their functionality has been conserved in our new flagship APIs.  

Each API listed below links to URL generation pages[^openapi] that serve as a form of concise, interactive
documentation (a link to fuller documentation also can be found at the top of each of these pages).  Although output
formats include open-standard WaterML, input arguments are USGS specific and do not conform to any open standard.

- [__Instantaneous-values data.__](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html)[^ivaka]  <span class="usa-tag">POPULAR</span> These 
are sensor observations and calculations of natural phenomena made at regular intervals (typically every 15 minutes).  These include stream
gage height, streamflow (discharge), water temperature, and much more.  If you need data only from the last 4 months, we recommend
our new flagship SensorThings API over this legacy API.  But if you need data farther back into the past, this continues to be the API you should 
use.  Its main output formats are tab-delimited file and WaterML.

- [__Daily-values data.__](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html)[^dviv]  From the 1880s until around 2007, continuous 
monitoring of water resources by the USGS typically resulted in one statistically reduced data value per day: the _daily-mean 
value_ (sometimes also daily minimum and maximum values).  This was a practical[^oneperday] number of data values that could convey 
water-resources in printed publications[^adr] and could be stored digitally up through the 1990s when computer 
storage was still prohibitively expensive.  Some workflows continue to rely on daily values, and any analyses or workflows that go
back in time before around 2007 usually must incorporate daily values to achieve historical continuity.  Our OGC API offers
a subset of USGS daily-values data (groundwater daily values), but until OGC API offers all daily-values data this legacy API may well
be what you must use.

- [__Discrete groundwater levels.__](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html)[^gwaka] Individual 
manual measurements of groundwater levels made by USGS technicians in the field.  These days the flagship OGC API 
provides these same data in a more modern format.  One key ability of this legacy API not (yet) offered by
OGC API is the ability to query for multiple monitoring locations at a time.

- [__Sites.__](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Test-Tool.html)[^siteaka]  Key metadata about 
USGS monitoring locations across the United States such as latitude and longitude, station name, county location, and 
so forth.  These days, this same metadata is available nearly equally well from SensorThings and OGC API in the 
popular GeoJSON format for getting dots on maps quickly.  But this legacy API continues to offer this information in 
tab-delimited files, as well as Keyhole Markup Language (KML), an XML open standard popular in the early 2000s.  One 
key ability this API offers that our flagship APIs do not (yet) provide is querying for monitoring 
locations based on the type of data they collect and the time range those data are available. (_e.g.,_ 
[all active monitoring locations in Kansas monitoring real-time water temperature](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/site/?format=rdb&stateCd=ks&parameterCd=00010&siteStatus=active&hasDataTypeCd=iv)).

- [__Statistical period-of-record data.__](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Statistics-Service-Test-Tool.html)[^statbeta]  This 
API outputs statistical information about time-series data from a USGS monitoring location.  It is most popularly known as 
the API that examines the full period of approved time-series streamflow at a monitoring location and, for each day of the 
year, calculates the long-term median, maximum, minimum, and other statistical flow percentiles
([example](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/stat/?sites=09382000&parameterCd=00060)).  This same statistical 
calculation is performed for all other approved time-series data and made available through this legacy API.  We have not
yet determined how we may convey these data in a flagship API, so until then this is the API you should use.

<!--- LEGACY OTHER ACCORDION SECTION START -->
<h2 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a7">
üï∏ Legacy Endpoints Still Uniquely Valuable <!--- ‚òéüï∏üëª -->
</button></h2>
<div id="a7" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Starting around the year 2000, we began publishing water data in machine-friendly flat-file formats on a national scale.
These URL endpoints are a primitive form of web service from an earlier time in the history of the Web.  They output
data in simple tab-delimited
[RDB files](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/?tab_delimited_format_info) and they do not conform to any open standard.
The input parameters (URL parameters) are not formally documented and must be deduced by (1) using search tools on web 
pages, (2) noting the resulting URL, and (3) cleverly incorporating the URL into your software  by modifying input 
parameters as needed.

**USGS intends to decommission these endpoints in the coming years, but not until adequate replacements have been developed.**  Until
then, although we caution that these old endpoints may be challenging to incorporate into modern software, you may
find them uniquely valuable if they provide the water data your application needs.

- [__Annual-peaks data.__](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/peak/)  The single highest flow rate and stream water level in a given 
year is a useful statistic for 
engineers and others concerned with planning related to water hazards.  In recent years these peak data values may be 
found directly within the instantaneous-values data records.  But sometimes, particularly at 
streamgages with long periods of record and large historic floods, the one annual-maximum flow and water level are _original, primary
data,_ not a mere statistical derivation of data in some 12-month time window.  In fact, in some cases weeks or even 
months of hydrologic analysis is undertaken to produce a _single_ annual-peak data value!  If your application needs these 
values, use the search tool linked to here, indicate tab-delimited output, and note the resulting URL (_e.g.,_ 
[annual-peak flows and gage height for Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/az/nwis/peak?site_no=09380000&agency_cd=USGS&format=rdb)).

- [__Rating-curve depot.__](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/get_ratings?help) Most users
do not need the technical and detailed rating curves used to convert gage-height[^wlaka] data to streamflow data; they 
simply need the high-quality streamflow data USGS publishes. But certain key
cooperating agencies like the National Weather Service need rating curves for their computer-modeling needs.  The ratings
depot provides this information, as well as a way to detect when rating curves have been updated by USGS staff.
The most popular output table is the expanded, shift-adjusted rating (EXSA), effectively a lookup table for all possible
valid values of gage height in hundredth-of-a-foot increments at a given station
(_e.g.,_ [the EXSA table for Barton Springs at Austin, Texas](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/data/ratings/exsa/USGS.08155500.exsa.rdb)). Only 
stage-discharge ratings are available; index-velocity and slope-area curves are not supported.

- [__Current surface-water conditions in historical context.__](https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/webservices/) If your application 
wishes to create a "dot map" of current streamflow[^dotmap] conditions‚Äîto what degree USGS monitoring locations are above and below
historical flow rates‚Äîpresently your most practical option is the _realtime endpoint_ of this catalog of legacy endpoints.  The 
output format is JSON, but not an open-standard format such as GeoJSON (_e.g.,_
[the data needed for a dot-map of Kansas](https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/webservices/realtime?region=ks)).  We
are considering how our flagship APIs might present this valuable information in an open-standard way.  It is also possible
to [calculate this information yourself](/stats-service-map/) using the legacy statistical period-of-record API and an API returning
the most recent instantaneous values.

- [__Discrete surface-water field measurements.__](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/measurements/)[^swaka]  To keep a continuous 
time-series monitoring location operating properly, USGS 
technicians periodically visit the station and manually measure water depths and flow rate.  These data 
help ensure USGS sensors and rating curves are functioning properly and get repaired and updated as needed.  Although typically seen as 
_means-to-an-end_ water data, they may be useful in some circumstances.  If your application needs these 
values, use the search tool linked to here, indicate tab-delimited output, and note the resulting 
URL (_e.g.,_ [all of these measurements for Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/measurements?site_no=09380000&agency_cd=USGS&format=rdb)).

<!--- ------------- -->

These web services and endpoints should no longer be used.  New users and existing 
users should consider using new flagship or beta APIs that provide the same 
water data in more modern formats.

- [__Legacy discrete water-quality data endpoint.__](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/qwdata/)  You can download 
tab-delimited "wide" formats of USGS 
water-quality data by using this search interface, indicating tab-delimited output, and noting the resultant 
URL ([example](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/md/nwis/qwdata/?site_no=01649190&agency_cd=USGS&inventory_output=0&rdb_inventory_output=file&TZoutput=0&pm_cd_compare=Greater%20than&radio_parm_cds=all_parm_cds&qw_attributes=0&format=rdb&qw_sample_wide=wide&rdb_qw_attributes=0&date_format=YYYY-MM-DD&rdb_compression=value&submitted_form=brief_list)).  Although this format
is convenient for certain workflows, we recommend the Water Quality Portal to obtain discrete water-quality 
data. We are in the latter stages of a multi-year modernization effort of our discrete water-quality data systems.  When
that modernization is complete, **we intend to decommission this web endpoint.** <!--- **This endpoint is scheduled to be discontinued January 2023** -->

- [__Legacy hydrograph bitmap endpoint.__](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph) A URL that generates a standalone bitmap 
image of a hydrograph using late 20th-century plotting
technology ([example](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/graph?agency_cd=USGS&site_no=01638500&parm_cd=00060&period=7)).  Please
try using our beta hydrograph bitmap-image API instead (above), and give us feedback on what you think of 
it.  **This endpoint is

[^cover]: Cover image adapted from [Alex Proimos from Sydney, Australia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book_Shelves_and_Computers_(5914150081).jpg), [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0).  The author is grateful for peer reviews from Julie Padilla, 
David Watkins, Jim Kreft, Blake Draper, Wade Walker, and Lee Stanish.

[^adr]: The USGS Annual Water Data Report was the definitive published record of water resources measured
by the USGS for decades: one large bound book per year, per state.  By 2014, USGS recognized the Web had 
become the American People's preferred method for obtaining published water data.

[^siteaka]: These days we prefer the term monitoring location, but historically the terms monitoring location, 
station, site, gage, gaging station, and streamgaging station all have been used rather 
interchangeably.  That is why this legacy API is somewhat ambiguously denominated 
the "site service."

[^statbeta]: Officially the period-of-record statistics API is still a beta üë©‚Äçüî¨ product!  During and after its 2007 development
we never found a suitable open-standard output format for these statistical data.

[^dviv]: Our users have suffered no end of confusion because of historical "siloing" of instantaneous-values and daily-values 
data.  We are considering ways we might someday provide APIs that unify these confusing data siloes in a 
no-nonsense ["best available"](/gw_bats/#how-do-we-know-which-record-is-best) way.

[^wlaka]: Water level surely must be the most plainspoken term for the common USGS measurement of a flowing river or waterway, but
other terms in common use include gage height, stage, river stage, and (in a numerically inverted sense) water depth.

[^dotmap]: There is no comparable published endpoint for generating "dot maps" for groundwater or 
water-quality current conditions, though a flagship API may include these in the future.

[^openapi]: To help with documentation, we are considering implementing OpenAPI specifications for these 
legacy APIs, which would allow anyone to use modern tools for testing and using them.  If you
think this would be helpful for you, please let us know.

[^ivaka]: We prefer the term instantaneous-values data these days, but other 
roughly synonymous terms include continuous data, time-series data,
unit-values data, UV ("you-vee") data, and real-time data (though that term is less about the 
frequency of data measurement and more designative of the fact that observations are made
very near the present moment and then promptly relayed to the Web).

[^gwaka]: Discrete groundwater level is the most precise term these days, but these
data also are known colloquially as field measurements or "tape-downs" owing to the 
instrument typically used by technicians to make the measurement.

[^oneperday]: One daily-mean value per day can be wholly adequate for large rivers and some
data analyses.  However, if processing power and storage space allow, instantaneous values might be
the preferred form of data as they are potentially richer in information.

[^swaka]: Discrete surface-water field measurements are also known as calibrations, 
gaugings, surface-water measurements, field measurements, or even simply "measurements," as ambiguous as that term may be.

[^jsonview]: JSON is a popular data-interchange format.  It is lightweight and easy to read, even for human eyes
[(more info)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Example URLs throughout this article return 
data in JSON format.  Many web browsers (_e.g.,_ Firefox) have
convenient built-in JSON viewers. Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and

[^pleasesteal]: Reverse engineering is encouraged, as is copying and pasting, forking, etc.  As public civil servants,
our work is done for _you_ and is in the public domain.  For example, the source code for monitoring location pages 
[is publicly viewable](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/iow/waterdataui).  Working
in the open is part of [how we work](/how-we-work-spring-2021/).

[^semantics]: Generally, the terms endpoint, web service, and API are used rather interchangably.
Only in this article have we attempted to enforce a consistent (if somewhat arbitrary) distinction to help readers
distinguish the older and the newer.

[^sorich]: Any single laboratory analytical result, in addition to the final quantitative value (_e.g._, 4.5 milligrams
per liter), can contain metadata including but not limited to: qualifier, method reporting level, analytical method,
laboratory free-text comments, analytical standard deviation, laboratory set numbers, sample preparation and analysis dates,
analyzing entity, and data-approval status.

[^restful]: In 2007 it was common to refer to APIs as web services.  Specifically, our 2007-era APIs are 
_RESTful web services._  For a time we also offered SOAP web services but they were decommissioned for lack of popular use.

[^pcodeymmv]: Parameter codes originated in the 1970s era of paper punch cards and they have become a confused (and
confusing!) domain of 5-digit codes. Discovering which 5-digit parameters codes are of interest can be challenging.  One 
approach can be to geographically search for monitoring locations that offer instantaneous-values data on
[the USGS water-data mapping tool](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/).
Efforts are underway eventually to discontinue using parameter codes in favor of newer techniques made popular
in open-standard formats such as Water Quality eXchange.
