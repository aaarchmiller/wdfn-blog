The USGS water data science branch in 2022
{{< figure src="/static/water-data-science-2022/ds-subteams-2022.png" alt="update this ***** A banner for the USGS Vizlab water data visualization team featuring an abstract streamgraph that mimics flowing water.">}}
--------------------
The USGS data science branch advances environmental sciences and water information delivery with data-intensive modeling, data workflows, visualizations, and analytics. A short summary of our history can be found in a [prior blog post](../water-data-science-2021#data-sci-background). Sometimes I refer to data scientists as _**experts in wrangling complex data and making it more valuable or usable**_.

Within the data science branch, we are advocates for open science and we build useful data science solutions that often increase scientific integrity, cost less over the long-run, and are accessible for others to build upon or reuse. We're also working to expand access, representation, and participation in federal science with [innovative hiring initiatives](../hiring-spring-2021#DIT) (including for [data visualization specialists](../viz-hires-2021/)). 

Our data science branch has grown and our capabilities have matured over the years. Now it is time for new changes that will contribute to more effective and sustainable work practices by: 1) launching new positions that will create more pathways for leadership and promotion, 2) adding new team structures that will be aligned with our data science sub-disciplines (visualizations, ML, web analytics, and reproducible data assembly), and 3) distributing supervisory responsibilities and vision to team leads.  


What are these capabilities/teams?
--------------------

### Visualizations
{{< figure src="/static/what-is-vizlab/viz-logo.png" alt="A banner for the USGS Vizlab water data visualization team featuring an abstract streamgraph that mimics flowing water.">}}

Our data visualization sub-team ("Vizlab") has been around since 2014, but is constantly evolving and [added staff this year](../viz-hires-2021/). Described by [Cee recently](../what-is-vizlab/) as "_**a collaborative team that uses data visualization to communicate water science and data to non-technical audiences. Our mission is to create timely visualizations that distill complex scientific concepts and datasets into compelling charts, maps, and graphics. We operate at the intersection of data science and science communication.**_" See also <a href="https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/vizlab-home/index.html#/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=wdfn&utm_campaign=what_is_vizlab#/" target="_blank" >Vizlab's portfolio site</a>.

Vizlab **right now** includes three full time federal employees and a mix of part time contributors. The group excels at producing new visualization content that ranges from social media (e.g., [#30DayChartChallenge](../chart-challenge-2022/)), complex interactives (e.g.,  [stream temperature in the Delaware River Basin](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/temperature-prediction/index.html#)), and storytelling like in [“From Snow to Flow”](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/snow-to-flow/index.html#). In addition to being excellent data communicators, Vizlab builds data workflows that make it faster to template or reuse content in the future, such as for recurring event types or seasonal summaries. 


Vizlab **in the future _could_** begin 
      
#### Where Vizlab could go: 
Templates for events, new visuals for explaining/exploring large environmental datasets, building processes for efficient code/data publication alongside visualizations.

### Machine learning
      where we are: forecasting, KGML, TERM hiring, capacity building, ML strategy, some XAI,
      where we could go: inference, operational data, KGML, integration with enterprise modeling, decision-focused model streams, PERM hiring and leadership, MLOps, mature XAI.
      
### Web analytics
      where we are:
      where we could go:
      
### Reproducible data assembly
      where we are: TERM hiring, targets/snakemake, collab code
      where we could go:

Other focal areas in 2022:
knowledge management
      DSP and DS manual, training, onboarding, mentoring, blogging
      
How we're going to hire in the near-term
      step one: supervisors
      step two: cluster hire for individual contributors
      step three: group hire for technical/process lead positions
