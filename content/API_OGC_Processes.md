## ‚ùî What is the NLDI and OGC-API-Processes Webinar?
In this webinar on our [Network Linked Data Index](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nldi-intro/) and Open Geospatial Consortium API ([OGC-API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/)), we'll give you a brief background on APIs in general, then Dave Blodgett will give a live demo of the Network Linked Data Index API and associated OGC-API-Processing algorithms to retrieve precise drainage basins and cross sections at specific network locations.

## üïõ When is it?
On Monday, April 25th, 2022 at 12 pm ET/ 9 am PT. **This webinar will be recorded. We'll post the recording about one week after the event** on this blog post, on our [WMA website](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources), and on the [USGS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeXH8GZyV3sVqAr45AvupOA).

## ü§© Tell me about the API Series
üôå At the United States Geological Survey, we're making high-quality water information discoverable, accessible, and usable for everyone.

Water data should be usable ü¶æ! Our modernized APIs provide a way for you to display our water data in the format that works best for you. Learn more about how & why to use USGS modernized APIs to integrate our water data in your applications.

In this API webinar series, we'll touch on what USGS water data is, then we'll discuss the API formats that have been used in the past and why the new API formats are better for you.
