### Our Commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Transparency 

The federal hiring process can be complicated to navigate. We don’t want that to be the reason you don’t apply. We are committed to inclusive hiring practices that build a healthy workplace where diversity is our strength, and everyone has the support they need to succeed. That starts right now, with us lifting the veil on the process of applying for federal jobs. We especially encourage you to apply if you are BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, have a disability, or are of any marginalized identity. Please read below for details on how the application process works. 


Positions
--------------------

 
#### Data Visualization Specialist {#data-viz}

We seek Data Visualization Specialist(s) to join our water data visualization team, the USGS Vizlab (Visualization Laboratory). The USGS Vizlab is a collaborative science communication team that uses data visualization to distill complex scientific datasets into compelling data-driven stories and graphics. These are positions at the intersection of environmental data science and science communication, with emphasis on reproducibility, accessibility, and creativity. See the Vizlab portfolio: [labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/vizlab-home/](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/vizlab-home/index.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=wdfn&utm_campaign=viz_hires#/)   

Specific duties may include the following: 
- Designing static and interactive data visualizations that communicate complex, data-driven concepts to non-technical audiences 
- Building and maintaining compelling web-based user interfaces for data visualizations 
- Developing reproducible data processing and data visualization pipelines 
- Contributing to data visualization engagement and outreach through blog posts, social media, and other venues 
- Collaborating with communications specialists, subject matter experts, and stakeholders to support USGS science objectives  

There will be two job announcements with the final locations negotiable. Both the GS-09 and GS-12 roles will be full-time, [permanent federal positions](https://www.usajobs.gov/help/working-in-government/appointments/) in the [Data Science Branch](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/water-data-science-2021/) of the Water Mission Area. These jobs will be open to candidates who can qualify for the [Biologist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0400/general-natural-resources-management-and-biological-sciences-series-0401/), [Physical Scientist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1300/general-physical-science-series-1301/), or [Mathematical Statistician](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1500/mathematical-statistics-series-1529/) job series. 

 
Additional Information 
--------------------

### The Process 
#### Calculating the value of the job
> **General Schedule Grades –** The pay and responsibilities of these Federal jobs are defined by general schedule (GS) Grades, which are roughly equivalent to the levels concept used elsewhere. The visualization positions will be advertised at both GS-09 and GS-12. The GS-09 will have promotion potential up to GS-12. The GS-12 position allows a candidate to apply for GS13 vacancies if the job series and roles are similar. 

> **Pay –** Salary bands are started at the Nation-wide GS Base Pay Scale and then adjusted for location. To find what salary band you’d be looking at, search “GS 2021 Salary Table + {{ Your location }}" and look at Grades 09 and 12. The “steps” in each grade are intermediate performance-based pay increases between grades. Typically, new hires into the federal government typically start at “Step 1”.  

> **Benefits –** These positions include health and life insurance, 5% retirement match, [11 federal holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2022), 13 sick days + 13 vacation days per year, paid parental leave, and accrual of federal service to count towards a pension (typically an additive 1% of the average of your highest 3 years of salary for each year of service). See [USGS human resources pay and benefits page](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/pay-and-benefits) for more details.

> **Intangibles -** If the mission of public service towards advancing environmental science communication and data delivery resonates with you, there will be no shortage of energy and motivation available when working with great colleagues on these challenges. Likewise, a flexible schedule and emphasis on work life balance are important components to work at the USGS.  

#### Applying for the job
> **Creating a USA Jobs account -** Both federal positions will be posted and filled using public vacancy announcements on [usajobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/). If you are remotely interested in applying to any of the positions mentioned here or elsewhere, get ahead by creating an account as soon as you can. Having an active account will allow you to set up job filters and get a jump start on getting your application materials together.  

> **Qualifying for GS grades -** We recognize that individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and different experiences will be able to excel at these jobs. That said, federal pay grades have requirements that applicants must meet for the system to pass you on to the pool that we can then review. We **CAN’T STRESS THIS ENOUGH**: see [USGS tips for combining graduate education and experience](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/combining-graduate-education-and#) and spell out how you meet the grade and job series qualifications. I’ve seen people attach an additional document to the hiring package that makes this math clear to HR. We will be advertising a combination of [Biologist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0400/general-natural-resources-management-and-biological-sciences-series-0401/), [Physical Scientist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1300/general-physical-science-series-1301/), and [Mathematical Statistician](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1500/mathematical-statistics-series-1529/) job series. 

> - GS-09 – This grade requires a Master’s degree or 2+ years of graduate coursework or 1+ year of professional experience equivalent to a GS-07 or multiple years of experience with a Bachelor’s degree. 

> - GS-12 – This grade is a high bar, requiring a PhD or 3+ years of graduate coursework or a masters degree and work experience or multiple years of experience with a Bachelor’s degree. 

> **Specialized experience -** The hiring process for the GS-09 and the GS-12 positions are slightly different due some technicalities within the federal hiring process, but both require specialized experience. The GS-09 position will be posted publicly and all applicants will undergo a two-step review process: first, a structured resume review by a subject matter expert, and then a structured interview to assess skills and qualifications for the position based on the specialized experience that we’ve defined for the role. Individuals that pass through both components of the review process will then be passed on to the hiring manager. For the GS-12 role, we’re using USGS’s [direct hire authority (DHA)](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/direct-hire-authorities) to post a public position and see a wide candidate pool. By using DHA, any candidate who meets the minimum educational and work experience for the job series (see above) and the specialized experience that we’ve defined for the role will be passed on to the hiring manager. For both roles, we expect a lot of applications and are planning on interviewing lots of people.  

> Specialized Experience includes the demonstration of specific skills for a minimum of one year, so make sure to be explicit about how you’ve met these requirements on your resume. 
> - _Required specialized experience for GS-09 Data Visualization Specialist:_ One year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-07 that demonstrates knowledge of appropriate data visualization techniques within project assignments, such as development of interactive or static charts or maps. Such experience must include: demonstrated experience analyzing data and creating charts, maps, or graphics using a programming language (e.g. R, Python, or javascript). 

> - _Required specialized experience for GS-12 Data Visualization Specialist:_ Experience will include intermediate-to-advanced skills with one or more data science programming languages (e.g., python and R) or experience building interactive visualizations (e.g., javascript libraries such as D3, Vue, etc). In addition to programming skills, experience should include strong communication skills and project/task management skills. Communication skills should demonstrate experience in communicating complex scientific concepts to non-technical audiences. Project management skills should include developing data visualization concepts from raw data and moving them to final products.   

> **Materials –** You’ll need a resume and educational transcripts (unofficial are OK). Again, to make sure HR can see that you’re qualified, make sure your resume explicitly ties your experience to each of the qualifications listed for the grades you are applying for and also the _Specialized Experience_ section. 

> **Application Window –** The application window will be open on USA Jobs for **ONLY 5 BUSINESS DAYS**, from Wednesday November 17th at 12:00am ET to Tuesday November 23rd at 11:59pm ET. That window is very short and unfortunately out of our control. We hope that by giving you this information now, it will allow you time to ask us any questions you may have and to prepare your application materials before this window closes.

> **Timeline –** After the application window closes, HR combs through applications and filters for candidates who meet the GS Grade qualifications and specialized experience. There are a few key differences between the review process for the GS-09 and the GS-12. Applications to the GS-09 position will undergo a structured resume review by a subject matter expert, followed by a structured interview to assess skills and qualifications for the position. Individuals that pass through this review will be passed on to the hiring manager – in this case, Jordan Read (he/him). For the GS-12, the entire list of qualified candidates will be passed on to the hiring manager.  

> For both positions, the hiring manager will contact all the qualified candidates for additional information and will set up interviews. After the listing closes, we estimate that the turn around time between the closing and the scheduling of the first round of interviews will be around 5-6 weeks. 

> From there, they will refer a selected candidate to HR, and HR will extend an offer. After HR makes an offer, that is your chance to negotiate the offer and ultimately accept or reject it. Once negotiations are done and you accept the offer, HR will perform a background check. Then you agree to a start date and at that time your employment at the USGS begins!
