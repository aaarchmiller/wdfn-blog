## SUMMARY
Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, the example monitoring location is 01584050, which is associated with a STREAM in BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND.

## COMMON REQUESTS    
### HOW CAN I VIEW 30-DAY RAINFALL DATA?
1.	Select the correct timeframe by selecting a preset timespan of 30 days.
2.	Select precipitation by choosing the correct data to graph.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
### PROVISIONAL DATA
If you select a large enough date range, like 1 year selected below, notice the difference in approved (blue line) versus provisional data (orange line  ). To understand the difference in these data, please read the definition and warning for provisional data.
 
## INTERACT WITH THE HYDROGRAPH
Move your computer mouse or tap your device’s screen over top of the plot to expose the date, time, and value on the graph.  
 
### COMPARE TO PREVIOUS DATA / DISPLAY MEDIAN
Select ‘Compare to last year’ and / or ‘Display Median’ to add historical data and statistical data, when available. Note: Median is never available for gage height, but it is sometimes available for other parameters.
 
 
### SELECT A PRESET OR CUSTOM TIME SPAN
Choose a 7-day, 30-day, or 1-year preset time span. 
Consider viewing the period of record for the specific parameter beforehand. To choose a custom date range, click “change time span.” The date range of your choice will populate once you click the second “change time span.” 
 
### ALTER THE TIMEFRAME
Drag the handles on the plot below the main plot to zoom in on a specific time frame. Drag the shortened window (shown in the highlighted red box below) to pan across other dates.
