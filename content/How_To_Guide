## SUMMARY
Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, the example monitoring location is 01584050, which is associated with a STREAM in BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND.

## COMMON REQUESTS    
### HOW CAN I VIEW 30-DAY RAINFALL DATA?
1.	Select the correct timeframe by selecting a preset timespan of 30 days.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
### PROVISIONAL DATA
If you select a large enough date range, like 1 year selected below, notice the difference in approved (blue line) versus provisional data (orange line). <i>These colors are subject to change with the evolution of this product; we will update this guide as necessary.</i> We encourage all users to familiarize themselves with the limitations of provisional data by reading the provision data statement linked below the hydrograph.
