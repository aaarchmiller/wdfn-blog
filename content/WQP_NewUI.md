Over the past several months, our team worked to redesign the User
Interface for the [Water Quality
Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/) (WQP) to create a more modern,
intuitive, and accessible website using principles of user-centered
design. Our team has started using the [United States Web Design
System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), which allowed us to build
our new website in an accessible, mobile-friendly way.

# Why did we make this change?

The former user interface for the WQP was created in 2012; since that
time, we've learned a lot about how people interact with the webpage. To
create a more user-oriented webpage, we 1) removed the legacy landing
page, 2) created basic and advanced query interfaces, 3) made webservice
links more visible and updated the documentation on how to use them, and
4) posted most recent data refresh dates, and 5) better visualized the
upstream/downstream mapper.

## Removed the Landing Page

Users were confused by the landing page and they didn't quite know where
to click to access data. This was confirmed with the high bounce rate
from the landing page; many people were leaving the page within seconds
of viewing it. We removed the wordy homepage, and instead send users
directly to the query form.

</div>

## Created Basic and Advanced Search Options

We wanted to make the WQP easier to use, and less confusing for
occasional users or members of the public trying to access data. Many
users just wanted to do a simple search, with only a few inputs for
their query. Therefore, we implemented a 'Basic' and 'Advanced' search
option, allowing users to control the amount of query fields they see.
Similarly, during user testing, we watched people struggle to understand
query fields. We modified our tool tips on query fields to use plainer,
simpler language so that users had a better understanding of their
meaning.

</div>


## Added Web Services Queries and Documentation

Over recent years, more users have discovered and started using the
WQP's web services and therefore wanted better guidance on constructing
queries. We added web service queries to the bottom of the Advanced
search form and re-wrote the [Web Services
Guide](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation/) with
added detail.

</div>

## Recent Data Refresh Dates Added

Users asked that we include information about when data in the WQP were
most recently updated, and we added that information to the footer.
While redesigning the footer of the webpage, we also increased the
visibility of our help desk contact information, so that users can get
their questions answered more quickly.

## Improving Location of Upstream/Downstream Mapper

People commented that they enjoyed using the Upstream/Downstream mapper,
but that it was in a confusing location in the query form. We've moved
this to a collapsible part of the Advanced search form and clarified the
wording about how this tool can be incorporated into a query.

# Still want to access the old User Interface?

We understand that our old User Interface was commonly used and
well-loved. We'll continue to keep the former User Interface accessible
to users for a few months, with plans to turn it off sometime in late
Spring of 2022. If you'd like to still use the old User Interface, you
can access it at:
[labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/wqp](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/wqp/).

# We're listening to you

We hope that this new interface is simpler, more intuitive, and easier
for you to use. We'd love to hear your ideas for continuing to make this
site better. Please email us at <gs-w-iow_po@usgs.gov> with your
thoughts.
