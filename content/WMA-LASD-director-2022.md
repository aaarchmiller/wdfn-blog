The U.S. Geological Survey’s Water Mission Area (WMA) is looking to hire an outstanding leader and manager to serve as the Director of the WMA's Laboratory and Analytical Services Division (LASD). We are committed to inclusive hiring practices that build a healthy workplace where diversity is a strength, and everyone has the support they need to succeed. We encourage applicants who are BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, have a disability, or are of any marginalized identity.  

Apply online at USAJobs, where the position will be open for submission of applications from **Monday, March 28 to Friday, April 15, 2022**. This job will close when we have received 75 applications, which may be sooner than the closing date.  

[USAjobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/) announcement:  
- [USGS-SAC-22-11423831-DHA-SD Supervisory Chemist (Director of the Laboratory and Analytical Services Division)](https://www.usajobs.gov/job/643848800)  

### About the position  
The LASD Director is responsible for overseeing all WMA-supported laboratories that conduct chemical analyses of water, sediment, and tissue samples collected by USGS Water Science Centers and our partners. We are looking for an experienced and dynamic individual with strong technical, communication, and management skills who will be tasked with overseeing the development and implementation of next generation analytical methods on an array of existing and emerging contaminants while also fostering collaborative research into new water-quality monitoring technologies such as eDNA, in-situ sensors, and remote-sensing technologies.

Other LASD Director duties include developing strategic plans for new and cost efficient services, methods, techniques and/or programs; serving as senior scientist responsible for oversight and leadership of scientific and technical guidance and policy; coordinating enterprise quality assurance/quality control practices to assure data quality and integrity; ensuring consistent, effective transition of research methods into production; establishing and maintaining contact with senior officials and technical leaders as well as non-Federal entities; and ensuring that all WMA laboratories are operated and maintained in a safe and responsible manner by complying with all relevant regulations and ordinances.

The position is a **GS-15 supervisory chemist with an annual salary of $144,612 (Step 01) to $176,300 (Step 10)**.  The position will be in Lakewood, Colorado; some relocation expenses will be provided.  

### About the LASD
The LASD currently employs about 110 employees and 30 contractors, has a total budget of approximately $28M annually, and consists of 20 laboratories that range from large fee-for-service laboratories to smaller specialty labs that support WMA research on hydrologic, water-quality, and ecologic processes. The LASD is comprised of four Branches: Strategic Laboratory Science Division (SLSB), Quality Systems Branch (QSB), Projects Laboratory Branch (PLB), and the National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL). The NWQL is located on the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado.  

The NWQL is the WMA’s flagship laboratory: it analyzes tens of thousands of water, sediment, and tissue samples annually. These samples are analyzed for hundreds of chemical constituents and physical properties and approximately 2 million individual analytical results are produced each year. These results are used by USGS scientists, partners, and stakeholders to evaluate the quality of the Nation's water resources, their suitability for use as drinking-water supplies, to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, and study the impacts of human activities and climate change on water quality temporally and spatially.

See USGS human resources pay and benefits page [here](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/pay-and-benefits) for more details. 

> **Intangibles -** If the mission of public service towards advancing water-resource monitoring, assessment, modeling, and research resonates with you, there will be no shortage of energy and motivation available when working with great colleagues on these challenges. Likewise, a flexible schedule and emphasis on work life balance are important components to work at the USGS.
