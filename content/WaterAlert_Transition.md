We‚Äôre proud to announce that the **Next Generation WaterAlert is coming soon** in August 2022.
Starting in June 2022, current WaterAlert users will be able to seamlessly transition their account and alerts to the modernized system using 3 simple steps. For users that need *early access* to the NextGen system before June, see the bottom of this blog post.

## ‚ùî What is WaterAlert?

**[WaterAlert](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/wateralert/) is a popular subscription service that allows users to subscribe to e-mail or text (SMS) messages when certain parameters, as measured by a USGS real-time data-collection station, exceed user-definable thresholds.** The development and maintenance of the WaterAlert system is supported by the USGS and its partners, including numerous federal, state, and local agencies.

Real-time data from USGS gages are transmitted via satellite or other telemetry to USGS offices at various intervals; in most cases, once every hour. Emergency transmissions, such as during floods, may be more frequent. Notifications will be based on the data received at these site-dependent intervals.

Read our [check status user blog post](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/user_check_status/) to get an idea of common use cases for WaterAlert.

## üê¥ What are WaterAlert users saying?
*From the horse's mouth.*

> "I have a cabin about 300 miles from my home. I appreciate getting the alerts **so I know if the water level is rising.** It helps me protect my property and stay informed."

> "I am a rescue diver and work for a trauma team, it‚Äôs important for me to know status of the flow."

> "This service lets us know if our land will flood and if we need to move our cars. There is a gage station near our house so this has become **an essential safety service.**"

## üéâ Why are we modernizing?
WaterAlert has been a tried-and-true service for years, but the system was aging and many users found navigating the system challenging at times, so we needed to modernize the system. Modernizing gave us the opportunity to provide new features and to make things look more approachable for all users! We're enthusiastic that the Next Generation of WaterAlert will be more discoverable, accessible, and usable for all users.

## üîë What are the NextGen key features?

> üëç **Streamlined account management:** Enjoy a more user-friendly way to manage your alerts, including a personalized user account where you can track and modify your existing alerts.

> üëç **Enhanced email alerts:** ¬†The emails are being upgraded to HTML emails, allowing for us to provide the data using UI techniques that make it easier to pull the important details out at a glance.

> üëç **Short-code SMS messages:** WaterAlert text messages are being updated to follow industry standards using short-code SMS messages ensuring¬†clarity for all users.

June 9th, 2022 | Transition Period is Open
June 9th, 2022 | 1st transition email to existing users

## ‚ùî What is Early Access?
For select users like people with a large number of subscriptions, or those who use it operationally for their work, we're offering access to the Next Generation of WaterAlert *before* the official transition period opens in June. Early access will provide users the opportunity to use the NextGen system while it undergoes its final changes. If they want, users may retain their alerts in the legacy system, but this means users will receive duplicate alerts (one from the NextGen system, one from the legacy system). 

*Early Access will never close.* **Confirm this with Shawna**

## üîî How can I request Early Access?
Email wdfn_usabilitytesting@usgs.gov with the subject: **WaterAlert Early Access**. Tell us about your role and your usage of WaterAlert.

Users will follow 3 simple steps to transfer their alerts:
1. Create an account if you don't already have one so you can login to the new system
2. **Transfer your alerts**
3. You're finished!

We will be posting more detailed written instructions and we'll have a video that walks users through how to transfer your alerts when it gets closer to June. We'll also be emailing all current WaterAlert users to give them plenty of time to transition.

In order to provide a better experience, we need to associate every subscription with a user authentication account, either through USGS's Active Directory (AD) or login.gov, a federal service that allows public users to interact with USGS water data.
