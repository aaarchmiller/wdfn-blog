## ‚ùî What is WaterAlert?

**[WaterAlert](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/wateralert/) is a popular subscription service that allows users to subscribe to e-mail or text (SMS) messages when certain parameters, as measured by a USGS monitoring location, exceed user-definable thresholds.** The development and maintenance of the WaterAlert system is supported by the USGS and its partners, including numerous federal, state, and local agencies.

Real-time data from USGS gages are transmitted via satellite or other telemetry to USGS offices at various intervals; in most cases, once every hour. Emergency transmissions, such as during floods, may be more frequent. Notifications will be based on the data received at these site-dependent intervals.

Read our [check status user blog post](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/user_check_status/) to get an idea of common use cases for WaterAlert.

</div>

## üê¥ What are WaterAlert users saying?
"*From the horse's mouth,*" direct quotes from WaterAlert users...

> "I have a cabin about 300 miles from my home. I appreciate getting the alerts **so I know if the water level is rising.** It helps me protect my property and stay informed."

> "I am a rescue diver and work for a trauma team, **it‚Äôs important for me to know status of the flow.**"

## üéâ Why are we modernizing?
WaterAlert has been a tried-and-true service for years, but the system was aging, making it vulnerable to breaking. Many users found navigating the system challenging, so we needed to modernize the system. Modernizing gave us the opportunity to provide new features and to make things look more approachable for all users! We're enthusiastic that the Next Generation of WaterAlert will be more discoverable, accessible, and usable for all users.

## üîë What are the NextGen key features?

> üëç **Streamlined account management:** Enjoy a more user-friendly way to manage your alerts, including a personalized user account where you can track and modify your existing alerts.

> üëç **Enhanced email alerts:** ¬†The emails are being upgraded to HTML emails, allowing for us to provide the data using UI techniques that make it easier to pull the important details out at a glance.

> üëç **Short-code SMS messages:** WaterAlert text messages are being updated to follow industry standards using short-code SMS messages ensuring¬†clarity for all users.

## üïï When will things happen?
Once the transition opens, if you do transition your alerts, you will receive up to three emails by the time the transition closes in Fall* 2022. Once you successfully transition your alerts, you will not receive any more reminders about the transition.

| Date | What Will Happen |
|------|----------|
Coming Soon/ TBD | Early Access available for select users
Summer* 2022 | Transition Period opens
Fall* 2022 | Transition Period closes
Fall* 2022 | Next Generation WaterAlert goes Live
Fall* 2022 | Legacy WaterAlert is Decomissioned

## ‚û° Transitioning Legacy users
Starting in summer* 2022, currents users of Legacy WaterAlert will be able to transfer their alerts to NextGen WaterAlert. Once users transfer, they will be able to see their account in NextGen WaterAlert. They'll be able to create, edit, and delete alerts in NextGen WaterAlert, **but alerts in NextGen WaterAlert will not be active until Legacy WaterAlert is decommissioned**.

**The transition period will be open for two months**. We'll be available to help you at any time, but we hope you'll find the process fast and easy to complete on your own.

### Users will follow 3 simple steps to transfer their alerts
1. Login or create an account*
2. **Transfer your alerts**
3. You're all done!

**Users will choose from [login.gov](https://login.gov/) or AD credentials. If you do not have a login.gov account, you can quickly and easily create one.*

Later this spring, we will post more detailed written instructions that will walk users through how to transfer, step-by-step. We will email all Legacy WaterAlert users to give them plenty of time to transition (see our timeline above), and we will text users as well.

Later this spring, re-visit this blog post or check out the [USGS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeXH8GZyV3sVqAr45AvupOA) for a short instructional video on transitioning your legacy WaterAlert subscriptions to the NextGen WaterAlert system.

## ‚ùî What is Early Access?
For select users like people who make safety decisions, those with a large number of subscriptions, or those who use it operationally for their work, we're offering access to Next Generation WaterAlert *before* NextGen access is open to everyone in the fall. Early access will provide users the opportunity to use the NextGen system while it undergoes its final changes.

## üîî How can I request Early Access?
Email wdfn_usabilitytesting@usgs.gov with the subject: **WaterAlert Early Access**. Tell us about your role and your usage of WaterAlert.

We are currently collecting names of people who are interested in requesting Early Access. **We will update this blog post and notify the approved users once we open Early Access closer to summer 2022.** Because of other dependencies, the date that Early Access will open is TBD.

<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/WaterAlert/Early Access WaterAlert.png" width="60%" caption="If you have a lot of alerts, have to make safety decisions, or have operational use-cases, request early access by emailing us at wdfn_usabilitytesting@usgs.gov with the subject WaterAlert Early Access. Please include your name and role!" alt="Next Generation WaterAlert *beta*. Try out WaterAlert beta. Request early access. If you have... a lot of alerts, to make safety decisions, or operational use-cases.

Why can't you just transfer my alerts automatically? <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->

<!--- ------------- -->

We wish we could! We know it would make a lot of our users happy. But, we can't for one big reason: users will have to login to NextGen WaterAlert. Because login is required, we are not able to automatically transfer alerts since the user's account needs to be set up first -- and that account set up, or login, must be done by the user. For public users who don't already have login.gov, the process to create an account is simple and easy. Thank you for understanding!

</button></h1>
<div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

In order to provide a better experience, we need to associate every subscription with a user authentication account, either through USGS's Active Directory (AD) or login.gov. Other government organizations (e.g., USA Jobs) currently use login.gov, a federal service that allows public users to interact with USGS water data.

Once the transition period opens, you will have two months to transfer your alerts from the legacy system. We'll be available to help you at any time, but we hope you'll find the process fast and easy.
<br>
At the time of transition, all subscriptions that have been associated with a user account will start using our upgraded service.<b>¬†Any subscriptions that have not transitioned will disappear when the legacy system is decommissioned. </b>
<br>
After the transition period closes, you'll need to login or create an account in order to create new subscriptions with the NextGen system. It's fast and easy! Check back later in the summer for a video we'll have that will walk users through how to create an account and alerts with NextGen Water Alert.
