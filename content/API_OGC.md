## ‚ùî What is the Application Programming Interface (API) Series?
üôå At the United States Geological Survey, we're making high-quality water information discoverable, accessible, and usable for everyone.

Water data should be usable ü¶æ! Our modernized APIs provide a way for you to display our water data in the format that works best for you. Learn more about how & why to use USGS modernized APIs to integrate our water data in your applications.

In this API webinar series, we'll touch on what USGS water data is, then we'll discuss the API formats that have been used in the past and why the new API formats are better for you.
