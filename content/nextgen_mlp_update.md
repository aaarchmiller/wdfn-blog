On April 11th, we hosted a [public webinar](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nextgen-webinar-apr11/) during which we updated our stakeholders on the progress of replacing [Legacy real-time pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=01584050) with [Next Generation Monitoring location pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/01584050/).

We anticipate to begin redirecting Legacy pages to NextGen pages in September 2022. This means when you click a bookmark for a Legacy page, your web browser will automatically redirect you to the NextGen page, but you'll still be able to access the Legacy page if you click on the link at the top of NextGen pages.

After adding many highly-requested features, we anticipate decommissioning the NWISWeb Legacy current-conditions real-time pages in July 2023.

Check out our [roadmap](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/roadmap/index.html) to follow along with specific feature requests. We update our roadmap quarterly.

## Some features we plan to add before the redirect in September 2022
(IS THIS LIST EXHAUSTIVE?)
- ✔ Add scale to map (complete!)
- ✔ Provide option to download data near data tables (complete!)
- Make data sortable by time
- Make Facebook shares more compelling with images
- New zoom options to improve interactivity with graph and axis
- Daily statistics for the latest day
- Multi-parameter feature (2 parameters on the same plot)

## Some features we plan to add before Legacy decommission in July 2023
- Better download capability
- Possible expansion of WSC-specified text fields like manuscript, location-level revisions (interaction with SIMS)
- Make wind direction parameter a set of discrete measurements (not continuous line)
- Features to better show water quality samples: Showing some field visit data with continuous water quality measurements; Having a summary of available water quality data
