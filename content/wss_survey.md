High-quality water information is fundamental for managing water resources, protecting life and property, and economic well-being, and the USGS makes this information discoverable, accessible, and usable for everyone. You may already be familiar with USGS water data, but did you know that USGS also provides basic water science information for all ages? 

## About the Water Science School

<b>The [USGS Water Science School](https://www.usgs.gov/wss) is designed to teach visitors all about water.</b> Each year, more than 8 million people visit the site to learn about the many aspects of water: [what it is](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/facts-about-water), [how much and where it is](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth), [how it cycles in and around the Earth](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/fundamentals-water-cycle), and [how it is used](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-use-information-topic). Water Science School offers articles about science topics, pictures, diagrams, and interactive educational activities. 

Students, teachers, other professionals, as well as curious information seekers all use the Water Science School. We’re always striving to improve the Water Science School usefulness and value for users. We do this through user-centered design, an iterative process that allows us to focus our designs based on our users’ needs. We're using user-centered design to redesign the Water Science School’s water cycle diagram (coming soon!).
