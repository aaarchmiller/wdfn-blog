# What are you decommissioning? 

As the USGS Water Mission Area (WMA) undertakes modernizing data
delivery as part of implementation of the U.S. Geological Survey Water
Science Strategy (Circular 1382-G; <https://doi.org/10.3133/cir1383G>),
resources will be directed away from legacy applications to new
development and delivery mechanisms. In 2020, several WMA web
applications are reaching end-of-life, are subject to critical
vulnerabilities, and/or are subject to increased licensing fees. In
order to continue operations, significant investment would be required
to upgrade existing systems and remain in compliance. Three applications
that were identified to be shut down (decommissioned) in the immediate
future are *Watershed Regressions for Pesticides*, *The Sediment Data
Portal*, and *Tracking Water Quality of the Nations Rivers*.

# What is the timeline? 


[Watershed Regressions for Pesticides](<https://cida.usgs.gov/warp/>) will be decommissioned on April 30, 2020.

The [Sediment Data Portal](<https://cida.usgs.gov/sediment/>) will be decommissioned on May 29, 2020.

[Tracking Water Quality of the Nations Rivers](<https://cida.usgs.gov/quality/rivers/home>) will be decommissioned on July 15, 2020. Users will be rerouted to a replacement for this website (not yet available).

# Where can I find the data after the applications are turned off? 

Continued, long term access to web application data will be provided viaalternative data repositories such as [Science Base](<https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/>) or [NWISWeb]([https://waterdata.usgs.gov](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/)). 

 

# What are the next steps? 

Some functionality currently provided in these web applications will be brought forward in Water Data for the Nation in the future(https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-tng/). 

 

# What about me? 

We want to hear users' feedback on how they access and use water quality data. In order to plan for future water quality data and information delivery, a listening session for water quality data users and users of these applications will be held in April 2020.  

Please stay tuned for additional information and contact <gs-w-iow_po_team@usgs.gov> with questions or to request more information on the upcoming listening sessions.
