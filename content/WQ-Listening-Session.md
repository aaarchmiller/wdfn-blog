Water Quality Data Delivery Listening Sessions
=============================================
Starting on August 3, 2020, the WDFN Team will be conducting a month of
activities aimed at gathering input from both internal and external
users to help guide development activities related to water-quality data
delivery.

Why are you doing this? 
------------------------

In 2020, our team [decommissioned three
applications](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/decommissioning-legacy-apps/)
that were instrumental in serving USGS water-quality data. Some functionality from those applications will be brought forward in future versions of [Water Data for the Nation](<https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-tng/>), and it is important for us to understand what is important to our users.

As we look to redesign our data flow and web presence, we must
understand who will be using our products and how they expect our
products to behave. We will design Water Data for the Nation with users
in mind. This is your chance to help us shape the future of
water-quality data delivery.

Who do you want to hear from? 
------------------------------

We want to hear from all users of USGS water-quality data. We're
interested in the opinions of current users of NWIS-web, or people who
use other water-quality applications that serve USGS data. This includes
internal users (USGS employees), external users (such as cooperators or
researchers), and members of the public. We also want to consider the
needs of future users, or people who want to access USGS data but are
intimidated or confused by our current data delivery system.

How can I give feedback? 
-------------------------

First and foremost, we want as many people as possible to fill out our
[survey](<https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=urWTBhhLe02TQfMvQApUlJP6YsKBCWFFs5dPG4HZbEJUQUJaSkFDVURYV0hPME5HTVA3SEJPU01ZNi4u>).
This will help us to understand who our users are, their satisfaction
with our current system, and how they ultimately use our data. The
survey also gives users the opportunity to give more detailed feedback
in an interview with our team. These interviews will be crucial to
helping us understand our users needs in more detail. Our team will be
announcing the link to this survey over social media and through emails
to our known users and colleagues. We'd appreciate your help in sharing
this link to people we may not have reached so we can hear from as many
current and potential users as possible.

For USGS employees, we will hold a WebEx to poll attendees about their
current use of [NWISWeb](<https://waterdata.usgs.gov>), and ask about
their hopes for a future system. This will give our internal users the a
direct line to our team.

What will you do with the information you collect? 
---------------------------------------------------

We recognize that as we plan for the future of Water Data for the
Nation, it is important to understand our audience and how best to serve
them.

The primary goal of our Listening Sessions is to craft users stories for
future development activities. User stories are short, simple
descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who
desires the new capability. We will synthesize the data collected in our
survey with the feedback we get during our WebEx and interviews into
user stories that tell us who our users are, what they want, and why
they want it. Then we will share these stories with our software
developers so they know how to build a user-friendly system.

As a bonus, we hope that the information we collect will also help us
better understand the current uses of NWISWeb. Specifically, we want to
know how people use our product in its current state, and how they apply
it to their science needs.

When should I expect to see changes to water-quality data delivery? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our legacy NWISWeb system is not going away any time soon. It will take
a long time to research, design, and implement our new Water Data for
the Nation water-quality data delivery system. Users can expect to see
beta versions of our changes in 2022, and continued improvements after
that. Opportunities to provide feedback will not end there. As we make
improvements to our beta version, we will embed mechanisms for users to
tell us how we are doing and welcome any comments you may have along the
way.

Who can I contact?

participate in an interview or offer your thoughts outside of the
Listening Session forums.
