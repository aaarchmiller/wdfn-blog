## ‚ùî What is the NextGen WaterAlert Webinar?
The United States Geological Survey monitors the waters of the nation. We display that data on Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages. But what if you don't want to check the pages when your local stream floods? What if you want to be notified automatically? Good thing we have a service for that called WaterAlert!

WaterAlert is a popular subscription service that allows users to subscribe to email or text (SMS) messages when certain parameters, as measured by a USGS monitoring location, exceed user-definable thresholds. In essence, users select the type of data they need, like streamflow/discharge¬†or gage height,¬†and WaterAlert will send notifications¬†once per hour or daily, whatever the user selects.

USGS is on a long-haul journey to modernize our water data delivery systems and WaterAlert is one of those data delivery systems. But in order for existing users to preserve their existing alerts in the Legacy system, they¬†will have to take action. **So in this webinar we'll walk you through those steps to transition to the NextGen system, and we'll answer any of your questions about WaterAlert.**
