### Our Commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Transparency 

The federal hiring process is complex, but we don’t want that to be the reason you don’t apply.  We are committed to inclusive hiring practices that build a healthy workplace where diversity is our strength and everyone has the support they need to succeed.  That starts right now, with us lifting the veil on the confusing process of applying for federal jobs. We especially encourage you to apply if you are BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Disabled, or are of any marginalized identity. Please read below for details on how the application process works. 


New hire positions

The location of the duty station for the employees is negotiable upon selection of a candidate. Positions will be in the Web Communication Branch (hiring manager Emily Read; eread@usgs.gov). The Term positions are renewable annually for up to 4 years. These jobs will be advertised under the [Physical Scientist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1300/general-physical-science-series-1301/) job series.

 

Additional Information 
--------------------

### Why Tuscaloosa?
USGS is building a new advanced hydrologic instrumentation facility and modeling center on the campus of the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, AL. This new building will open in 2023 and host dozens of USGS staff focused on innovating how we monitor and model water in the U.S. Until the doors open on this new USGS facility, staff will be stationed at the NOAA National Water Center (also located on campus in Tuscaloosa) and begin to forge cross-agency collaborations with NOAA on the mutual priority of advancing water prediction. Several of the positions closely tied to modeling will be advertised with Tuscaloosa duty stations in order to bring new modeling talent into this innovation. 


### The Process 

We’re here to answer any questions you have about what we do and how to navigate the application process. HR’s application window will be tight – only 5 days between March 15th and March 19th – which is why we’re letting you know now. Plus, we have some information that will hopefully help you navigate the process of applying to a federal job.  It can get confusing, but you’re awesome and we want to get to know you! 

#### Calculating the value of the job
> **General Schedule Grades –** The pay and responsibilities of these Federal jobs are defined by general schedule (GS) _Grades,_ which are roughly equivalent to the levels concept used elsewhere. These positions will be advertised at both GS 11 or 12 (for data scientists and machine learning specialists), or only at GS 12 (in the case of the product manager roles). 

> **Pay –** Salary bands are started at the Nation-wide GS Base Pay Scale and then adjusted for location. To find what salary band you’d be looking at, search _"GS 2021 Salary Table + {{ Your location }}"_ and look at Grades 11 and 12. The "steps" in each grade are intermediate performance-based pay increases between grades. 

> **Benefits –** These positions include health and life insurance, 5% retirement match, 10 federal holidays, 13 sick days + 13 vacation days per year, paid parental leave, and accrual of federal service to count towards a pension (typically an additive 1% of the average of your highest 3 years of salary for each year of service). 

> **Intangibles -** If the mission of public service towards advancing environmental science and data delivery resonates with you, there will be no shortage of energy and motivation available when working with great colleagues on these challenges. Likewise, a flexible schedule and emphasis on work life balance are important components to work at the USGS. 

#### Applying for the job
> **Creating a USA Jobs account -** All of these federal positions will be posted and filled using public vacancy announcements on [usajobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/). If you are remotely interested in applying to any of the positions mentioned here or elsewhere, get ahead by creating an account as soon as you can. Having an active account will allow you to set up job filters and get a jump start on getting your application materials together. 

> **Qualifying for GS 11 or 12 -** These grades are a high bar, requiring a PhD **_or_** a masters degree and work experience **_or_** multiple years of experience with a Bachelor's degree. We recognize that people with lots of different experiences will be able to excel at these jobs. That said, federal pay grades have requirements that applicants must meet for the system to pass you on to the pool that we can then review. We **CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH**: see [USGS tips for combining graduate education and experience](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/combining-graduate-education-and#11) and spell out who . We will be advertising a combination of  [Biologist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0400/general-natural-resources-management-and-biological-sciences-series-0401/), [Physical Scientist](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1300/general-physical-science-series-1301/), and [Mathematical Statistician](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1500/mathematical-statistics-series-1529/) job series. 

> **Specialized experience -** We're using [USGS's direct hire authory](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/human-capital/direct-hire-authorities) (DHA) to post public positions and see a wide candidate pool. We expect a lot of applications and are planning on interviewing lots of people. By using DHA we will be able to consider any candidate who meets the minimum educational and work experience for the job series (see above) and also _Specialized Experience_ that we've defined for the role. _Specialized Experience_ includes the demonstration of specific skills for a minimum of one year, so make sure to be explicit about how you've met these requirements on your resume. 

> **Materials –** You’ll need a resume and educational transcripts (unofficial are OK). Again, to make sure HR can see that you’re qualified, make sure your resume explicitly ties your experience to each of the qualifications listed for the grades you are applying for and also the _Specialized Experience_ section. 

> **Application Window –** The application window will be open on USA Jobs for **ONLY 5 DAYS**, from Monday March 15th at 12:00am ET to Friday March 19th at 11:59pm ET.  That window is really, really short.  It’s unfortunately out of our control. We’re telling you this now so you can ask questions and prepare your materials in time so that you can apply while the window is open. 

> **Timeline –** After the application window closes, HR combs through applications and filters for candidates who meet the GS Grade qualifications and specialized experience.  Then they’ll pass on that entire list to the hiring managers – in this case, Jordan Read, Emily Read, and Julie Kiang. The hiring managers will contact all the qualified candidates for additional information and will set up interviews, visits, or writing/code requests. From there, they will refer a selected candidate to HR, and HR will extend an offer. After HR makes an offer, that is your chance to negotiate the offer and ultimately accept or reject it. Once negotiations are done and you accept the offer, HR will perform a background check. Then you agree to a start date and at that time your employment at the USGS begins!
