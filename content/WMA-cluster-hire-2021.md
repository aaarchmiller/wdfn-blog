The U.S. Geological Survey Water Mission Area is hiring multiple Data Scientists, Machine Learning Specialists, and Water Information Product Managers. Apply online at USA Jobs, where the positions will open and applications will be accepted March 15-19th.  For all positions, an unofficial transcript and detailed resume summarizing job qualifications and relevant skills is needed. 

(We will continue to update this page with information, including direct links to the vacancies as soon as they are available.) 

 
Data Scientist {#data-scientist}
--------------------
We are seeking Data Scientist to help us build out new work on advanced modeling of water availability, water quality, and water hazards. Our new Integrated Water Prediction program involves a mix of process-based and data-driven modeling approaches and will rely on strong data infrastructure and workflows. Projects are designed to use a collaborative team of teams approach. Positions will be in the Analysis and Prediction Branch (hiring manager Julie Kiang; jkiang@usgs.gov) and the Data Science Branch (hiring manager Jordan Read; jread@usgs.gov). Specific duties will be related to projects in the following:  

- Data assimilation forecasting of water conditions 
- Observing system simulation experiments which will be used to inform future monitoring locations 
- Building publicly useable data releases for sharing model outputs, inputs, parameters, and derivative metrics
- Building workflows for data access, analysis, visualization, and modeling 

There will be two job announcements – one for Tuscaloosa, Alabama and one with the location negotiable.  Both announcements will be for GS11 or GS12 Term positions, which are renewable annually for up to 4 years. 

 

Machine Learning Specialist {#machine-learning}
--------------------
We are seeking Machine Learning Specialists to help us build out new work on advanced modeling of water availability, water quality, and water hazards. Our new Integrated Water Prediction program involves a mix of process-based and data-driven modeling approaches to improve hydrologic understanding and provide information on current and historical conditions. Positions will be in the Analysis and Prediction Branch (hiring manager Julie Kiang; jkiang@usgs.gov) and the Data Science Branch (hiring manager Jordan Read; jread@usgs.gov). Projects are designed to use a collaborative team of teams approach.  Specific tasks may include: 

- Integration of machine learning and deep learning approaches with existing process-based modeling 
- Use of machine learning methods to distill large model outputs into useful information
- Using machine learning to create emulators (models that attempt to produce the same outputs when given the same inputs) of other models
- Finding efficiencies in data processing workflows and feature extraction with machine learning 

 

There will be two job announcements – one for Tuscaloosa, Alabama and one with the location negotiable.  Both announcements will be for GS11 or GS12 Term positions, which are renewable annually for up to 4 years. 

 

Water Information Product Managers {#water-information-manager}
--------------------
Three GS 12 Term Product Managers positions are opening up in the USGS Water Web Communications Branch. These positions will work on a cross functional team that includes water scientists, software engineers, and design experts. The team makes high quality water information discoverable, accessible, and usable for everyone through web applications and APIs. Our team is committed to government tech innovation, working in the open, user-centered design, and agile methodology. The location of the duty station for the employees is negotiable upon selection of a candidate. Positions will be in the Web Communication Branch (hiring manager Emily Read; eread@usgs.gov). The Term positions are renewable annually for up to 4 years.
