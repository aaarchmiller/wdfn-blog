## ‚ùî What is the Application Programming Interface (API) Series?
üôå At the United States Geological Survey, we're making high-quality water information discoverable, accessible, and usable for everyone.

Water data should be usable ü¶æ! Our modernized APIs provide a way for you to display our water data in the format that works best for you. Learn more about how & why to use USGS modernized APIs to integrate our water data in your applications.

[In this API webinar series](https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/application-programming-interface-series-95289), we'll touch on what USGS water data is, then we'll discuss the API formats that have been used in the past and why the new API formats are better for you.
