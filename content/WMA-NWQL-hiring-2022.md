### About the National Water Quality Laboratory 
The NWQL is the WMA’s flagship laboratory: it analyzes approximately forty thousand water, sediment, and tissue samples annually. These samples are analyzed for hundreds of chemical constituents and physical properties and approximately 2 million individual analytical results are produced each year. These results are used by USGS scientists, partners, and stakeholders to evaluate the quality of the Nation's water resources, their suitability for use as drinking-water supplies, to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, and study the impacts of human activities and climate change on water quality temporally and spatially. The NWQL is located on the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. It is one of four branches within the WMA’s Laboratory and Analytical Services Division.
