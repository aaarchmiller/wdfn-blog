1. I think the old website works fine, why do you feel the need to change it?  <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a1" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The old website has served the public well, but it is 25 years old‚Äîthat‚Äôs about 80% of the entire history of the World Wide Web!  Over the last 10 years, we have observed declining user satisfaction with the old website; novice users in particular tell us the legacy pages are challenging to understand and not intuitive to use.  Under the hood, the programming has become outdated and has become difficult to maintain and it is practically impossible to add new features.  The best way for us to serve the public well into the future is to modernize our pages.

</button></h1>
<div id="a2" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

We know a multi-station or multi-parameter feature is highly requested from users. We're addressing this by gathering more use-cases and undertaking a discovery project in 2022. We're excited for this feature to be released, but each feature takes time to produce and we're working on many features, so [we‚Äôve committed to addressing this](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nextgen-mlp-update/) before the next step in the decommission process which we anticipate will occur in September 2022.

3. What will happen to all of the other USGS water data on legacy pages? I don‚Äôt see it on the new pages...   <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The NextGen pages will continue to evolve over time, adding new features and incorporating key information available on legacy pages. Current-condition real-time water data account for over 90% of our water-data web page requests, but we understand that other types of water data are very important to some users. These other forms of water data available in legacy pages‚Äîdaily values, statewide streamflow tables, annual-peak values, and many more‚Äîwill be evaluated for modernization in the coming years.  Eventually the entire old legacy website will be turned off (decommissioned) but that will not happen until we are able to evaluate the importance of all water data currently available on legacy pages.

<h1 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a4">
4. Why do you now show only one hydrograph instead of a long page of many hydrographs?  <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

<b>Interactive:</b> Users, #WeHearYou ‚Äì you wanted an interactive hydrograph, so we made that a top priority in the early development of the new pages. Users wanted to view the data on their mobile devices, and they wanted to interact with many elements of the graph like data shown, time span, and calculated median data. 
<br>
<b>Fast load time:</b> A single interactive hydrograph is fast for the default 7-day view, but takes some time to load data as users select longer time spans. Based on current technology, we do not advise that a single page provide interactive hydrographs for all possible parameters, as it would not allow for fast loading on mobile devices. Although there are multiple graphs on the legacy pages, those are not interactive, and the technology difference is vast between the two styles of use.
<br>
<b>Improved usability:</b> During user testing we have found that users are confident in interacting with the hydrograph. Our usage metrics show that people use the interactive elements commonly and intuitively.  
<br>
<b>Future plans:</b> We will continue to build out the interactive elements to allow multiple parameters to show simultaneously to provide a more robust experience for our users.

5. Why is the default parameter gage height? It doesn‚Äôt work best for me.   <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a5" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

We have an easy way for you to customize your default parameter: bookmarking a page that shows discharge will show discharge again when that bookmark is revisited. We acknowledge the value of the other common parameter: volumetric streamflow (discharge) data. But at this time, feedback from the general public has been that gage height is preferred as the default parameter. Read more about the importance of gage height in our recent blog post.

6. Are real-time pages of today being discontinued?   <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a6" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Eventually, yes.  Starting in October 2021 the legacy pages will no longer be the preferred view the public sees and search engines index.  In March 2022, the Next Generation pages will become the default view and legacy pages will redirect to them.  In January 2023 the legacy real-time current-condition pages will be decommissioned entirely.

7. After NWISWeb legacy real-time pages begin redirecting, will they still be viewable in some manner? <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a7" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->
 
Yes, they will remain viewable until their full January 2023 decommissioning.  A special link on a NextGen page will let users reach these pages after redirecting begins.  Note that after redirects begin, search engines will show legacy pages less and less in search results.

8. After NWISWeb legacy pages are decommissioned, will web redirects be in place? <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a8" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Yes.  When possible, old URLs will redirect to a modernized, relevant alternative.  When not possible, we plan to redirect to a web page explaining where to find various types of water data.

</button></h1>
<div id="a9" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

No, only the current-condition real-time pages.  All other pages like daily values, statewide streamflow, Water-Year Summary, will be evaluated and decommissioned on a case-by-case basis, leading to an eventual full decommission.  But that date is not yet known.

<div id="a10" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

They were excellent for their time, much like a classic car represents the best of its era. We know there is room for improvement to meet changing standards and broad user needs, which is why we are releasing NextGen pages.

11. What are the features of Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages?  <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a11" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The redesign of real-time pages is based on several sources of information: a comprehensive inventory of existing NWISWeb functionality, customization of pages by USGS Water Science Centers, user surveys, web analytics, and the USGS Water Science Strategy.  The new user interface is more accessible for all users‚Äîespecially new ones. The re-design puts data at the top of the page, is mobile ready, uses human-readable names and terms, and is built for integration with other applications and data sources. The codebase and infrastructures are optimized for performance and up-time, and instrumented with auditing tools and vulnerability detection. <b>Data integrity remains paramount.</b> Finally, an iterative software development process will engage all users early in the development process and produce frequent, meaningful improvements.

<h1 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a12">
12. Will NextGen Monitoring Location Pages continue to get new capabilities past year 2021?  <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a12" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Yes, for several reasons but let's consider the principal one:  we are still modernizing old systems and then turning them off!  So things like discrete water-quality data, annual-peaks data, daily-values data, and more must be fairly represented in modernized pages.  We will be sharing our roadmap and backlog of feature requests so you can understand what might be coming. 
</div>

<!--- Common Questions START -->
<h1 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a13">
13. I use one certain capability on the old system.  Will that capability be maintained in the modernized system? <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a13" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

It depends.  For real-time current-condition pages, the answer was and is "Yes!"  For other capabilities, we are evaluating them on a module-by-module basis.  Features may be modernized, may be discontinued, or in some cases reconceived in a very different way based on what has been learned from 25 years of water data on the web.

<h1 class="usa-accordion__heading"><button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a14">
14. Will modernized systems have my favorite feature x, y or z?  <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a14" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

We are working on publishing a roadmap and/or feature backlog for you to view for yourself.  As of late 2021, examples of important features considered for modernization are: discrete water-quality data, imagery such as cameras, multiple parameters on one plot, daily-values data, annual-peaks data, and downloadable plots.  If usability tests and analytics indicate a feature was not used or was difficult to understand, we might not keep it.

15. Will you be building multi-station summary views like the statewide streamflow table, multi-station graphs, and reports? <!--- üö¢üõ•‚õ¥üöÄ -->
</button></h1>
<div id="a15" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

The WDFN team in Water Mission Area is collecting these use cases and plan to undertake a "discovery" research project on these in FY22.  We understand cooperators fund networks of gages (not individual gages), but we also must ensure members of the public derive value from these types of reports.

</button></h1>
<div id="a16" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Yes, we plan to develop a new explore, filter, and download user interface in FY22.  We also know that external search engines are the source of most web traffic to real-time pages, so we will be making the redesigned pages as ‚Äúcrawlable‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù to search engine robots as possible.

<div id="a17" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->

Yes, more than ever. We are here to listen. Constructive feedback is intrinsic to our design process.  By users‚Äô feedback and through their actions (tracked by web analytics), we continue to optimize design and functionality.

</button></h1>
<div id="a22" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->
Yes! Thanks to your feedback, we have prioritized offering a feature that will display daily statistics for the latest day. We expect to release that feature before we redirect legacy real-time pages to Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages, which is the next step in decommissioning the legacy pages.
</div>

<div id="a23" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->
We are planning to include statistical information in tabular format for discharge. We know this is important information for our users, so we are prioritizing providing this in the most intuitive way possible. In order to do that, we are researching different methods to display the data by conducting a Discovery.

</button></h1>
<div id="a24" class="usa-accordion__content">
<!--- ------------- -->
Although this feature is not available on all Legacy Current-Conditions Real-time pages, we can completely understand how important that information is for our users, whether you are looking to go fishing in a few days, or whether you are an emergency mananger needing to prepare.


But USGS does not provide forecasting data, the [National Weather Service (NWS)](https://www.weather.gov/) does, so on some of our Legacy pages, Water Science Centers offer a link to the forecasting information provided by the National Weather Service's [Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service](https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=mob).

On our Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages, we do not have a link to the NWS's flood forecasting pages, however, in an attempt to meet user needs, we are researching if it's possible for us to provide that forecasting information on the NextGen pages.

We don't always have median data available for one of two reasons:
