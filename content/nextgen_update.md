## üîë Key take-aways, post-webinar

During this webinar, we updated users on our [anticipated timeline for release of new features](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nextgen-mlp-update) on our Monitoring Location Pages.

We also announced that our real-time notification service, WaterAlert, [is being modernized](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wateralert-transition/). Users will have an opportunity to transfer their alerts from the Legacy system to the Next Generation system during a 2-month transition period that we anticipate to open in summer 2022, likely in June. Users will be notified up to 3 times during the 2-month transition period if they do not take immediate action to transfer their alerts. Next Generation WaterAlert's anticipated go-live date will be in the fall of 2022, likely in August.
If users do not transition their alerts during this 2-month period, their Legacy alerts will permanently disappear when the Legacy system is decommissioned in fall 2022. They will be able to create new alerts in the NextGen system.

## ‚ùî What is this webinar about?

USGS has provided water data on the web for decades, and that data is important to many users from recreationalists to critical decision-makers. Some of our data delivery systems are outdated and can no longer be updated. In order for our water data to be effectively used, we have to modernize our systems, so Water Resources Mission Area has been gradually replacing legacy systems. In this webinar, we'll talk about our modernization process in general, then we'll dive deeper into the Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages and WaterAlert.

Monitoring Location Pages provide real-time water data to users. [Read our blog post](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/realtime-pages-replacement/) about the modernization of legacy current conditions pages into NextGen monitoring location pages.

WaterAlert is a subscription service to real-time notifications of water levels for active gages. Check out our [detailed blog post on Next Generation WaterAlert](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/WaterAlert-transition/).

*P.S. You'll get a first look at NextGen WaterAlert when Product Owner Randi Butler gives a live demo. üôåü•≥*
