# Summary
## Monitoring Location Pages
During this webinar, we notified users that our timelines have shifted for NextGen Monitoring Location Pages.
Instead of redirecting the pages in March of 2022, we¬†will be redirecting the pages in September 2022. We will be decommissioning the NWISWeb current-conditions real-time pages in July 2023. They are our most popular pages on the National Water Information System Web (NWISWeb)¬†and they are being¬†replaced¬†with Next Generation Monitoring Location pages. By July 2023, NextGen pages will have all of the critical functionality of the legacy pages and more, so we will be ready to say thank you¬†and¬†goodbye to these popular legacy real-time current-conditions pages.
## WaterAlert
We announced Next Generation WaterAlert is coming in August 2022. The transition period for all users will open in June 2022 and close when the NextGen system goes live in August 2022. If users do not transition their alerts during this 2 month period, their alerts will permanently disappear. They can create new alerts in the NextGen system.

## ‚ùî What is this webinar about?

USGS has provided water data on the web for decades, and that data is important to many users from recreationalists to critical decision-makers. Some of our data delivery systems are outdated and can no longer be updated. In order for our water data to be effectively used, we have to modernize our systems, so Water Resources Mission Area has been gradually replacing legacy systems. In this webinar, we'll talk about our modernization process in general, then we'll dive deeper into the Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages and WaterAlert.

Monitoring Location Pages provide real-time water data to users. [Read our blog post](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/realtime-pages-replacement/) about the modernization of legacy current conditions pages into NextGen monitoring location pages.

WaterAlert is a subscription service to real-time notifications of water levels for active gages. Check out our [detailed blog post on Next Generation WaterAlert](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/WaterAlert-transition/).

*P.S. You'll get a first look at NextGen WaterAlert when Product Owner Randi Butler gives a live demo. üôåü•≥*
