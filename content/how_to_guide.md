## Summary
This document is a how-to guide for using the USGS Water Monitoring Location Pages, which can be used to access data from thousands of water monitoring location across the United States, US, territories, and outlying areas. This document describes how to use features available in these web pages, as well as common questions users ask. Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, the example monitoring location is 01584050, which is associated with a STREAM in BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND.

## Important information
### Provisional data
In an effort to make water data and information available to users as rapidly as possible, the USGS releases data in near real-time in a provisional status. After technicians review the data and make any necessary corrections, the data are approved. In the hydrograph, provisional and approved data are shown in different colors.
If you select a large enough date range, like 1 year selected below, notice the difference in approved (blue line) versus provisional data (orange line). <i>These colors are subject to change with the evolution of this product; we will update this guide as necessary.</i> We encourage all users to familiarize themselves with the limitations of provisional data by reading the provision data statement linked below the hydrograph.

## Interact with the hydrograph

Move your computer mouse or tap your device’s screen over top of the plot to expose the date, time, and value on the graph.
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/how-to-guide/2_interact w hydrograph.png" caption="Notice the red boxes that highlight the selected condition, which in this example is gage height, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for '[Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/01584050/)'." alt="Screenshot that highlights the selected condition on the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD." >}}
</div>

### Compare to previous data / display median
Select ‘Compare to last year’ and / or ‘Display Median’ to add historical data and statistical data, when available. Note: Median is never available for gage height, but it is sometimes available for other parameters.
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/how-to-guide/3_display median.png" caption="Notice the red box is highlighting the toggle options for 'compare to last year' and 'display median,' which are located below the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for '[Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/01584050/)'." alt="Screenshot that highlights the toggles for 'compare to last year' and 'display median,' located below the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD." >}}

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Are real-time pages of today being discontinued? 
Eventually, yes.  Starting in October 2021 the legacy pages will no longer be the preferred view the public sees and search engines index.  In March 2022, the Next Generation pages will become the default view and legacy pages will redirect to them.  In January 2023 the legacy real-time current-condition pages will be decommissioned entirely. 

### After NWISWeb legacy real-time pages begin redirecting, will they still be viewable in some manner?   
Yes, they will remain viewable until their full January 2023 decommissioning.  A special link on a NextGen page will let users reach these pages after redirecting begins.  Note that after redirects begin, search engines will show legacy pages less and less in search results. 

### After NWISWeb legacy pages are decommissioned, will web redirects be in place?
Yes.  When possible, old URLs will redirect to a modernized, relevant alternative.  When not possible, we plan to redirect to a web page explaining where to find various types of water data. 

### Wait! Are you turning off all of NWISWeb legacy in January 2023? 
No, only the current-condition real-time pages.  All other pages like daily values, statewide streamflow, Water-Year Summary, will be evaluated and decommissioned on a case-by-case basis, leading to an eventual full decommission.  But that date is not yet known. 

### You’re calling the old NWISWeb pages “legacy” pages. What do you mean? 
They were excellent for their time, much like a classic car represents the best of its era. We know there is room for improvement to meet changing standards and broad user needs, which is why we are releasing NextGen pages. 

### What are the features of Next Generation Monitoring Location Pages? 
The redesign of real-time pages is based on several sources of information: a comprehensive inventory of existing NWISWeb functionality, customization of pages by USGS Water Science Centers, user surveys, web analytics, and the USGS Water Science Strategy.  The new user interface is more accessible for all users—especially new ones. The re-design puts data at the top of the page, is mobile ready, uses human-readable names and terms, and is built for integration with other applications and data sources. The codebase and infrastructures are optimized for performance and up-time, and instrumented with auditing tools and vulnerability detection. <b>Data integrity remains paramount.</b> Finally, an iterative software development process will engage all users early in the development process and produce frequent, meaningful improvements. 

### Will NextGen Monitoring Location Pages continue to get new capabilities past year 2021? 
Yes, for several reasons but let's consider the principal one:  we are still modernizing old systems and then turning them off!  So things like discrete water-quality data, annual-peaks data, daily-values data, and more must be fairly represented in modernized pages.  We will be sharing our roadmap and backlog of feature requests so you can understand what might be coming. 

### I use one certain capability on the old system.  Will that capability be maintained in the modernized system? 
It depends.  For real-time current-condition pages, the answer was and is "Yes!"  For other capabilities, we are evaluating them on a module-by-module basis.  Features may be modernized, may be discontinued, or in some cases reconceived in a very different way based on what has been learned from 25 years of water data on the web. 

### Will modernized systems have my favorite feature x, y or z? 
We are working on publishing a roadmap and/or feature backlog for you to view for yourself.  As of late 2021, examples of important features considered for modernization are: discrete water-quality data, imagery such as cameras, multiple parameters on one plot, daily-values data, annual-peaks data, and downloadable plots.  If usability tests and analytics indicate a feature was not used or was difficult to understand, we might not keep it. 

### Will you be building multi-station summary views like the statewide streamflow table, multi-station graphs, and reports? 
The WDFN team in Water Mission Area is collecting these use cases and plan to undertake a "discovery" research project on these in FY22.  We understand cooperators fund networks of gages (not individual gages), but we also must ensure members of the public derive value from these types of reports. 

### NWISWeb legacy data discovery and site navigation has always been awkward. Are you fixing this? 
Yes, we plan to develop a new explore, filter, and download user interface in FY22.  We also know that external search engines are the source of most web traffic to real-time pages, so we will be making the redesigned pages as “crawlable” and “friendly” to search engine robots as possible. 

### Do you still want input from USGS employees and the public? 
Yes, more than ever. We are here to listen. Constructive feedback is intrinsic to our design process.  By users’ feedback and through their actions (tracked by web analytics), we continue to optimize design and functionality. 

### How do you accept feedback and feature requests? 
New pages have a button on the footer labeled "Questions or Comments."  Submission here go directly to our product management team. 

### Will you build a mobile app? 
No.  At this time with limited resources we are focused on building the best mobile-first website we can.  There are no plans to build platform-specific apps at this time.  

 ### Why is gage height the default surface-water parameter on new pages? 
We acknowledge the value of volumetric streamflow (discharge) data.  But at this time feedback from the general public has been that gage height is preferred as the default parameter.  '[Read more about the importance of gage height.](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/gage_height/)' Please note that bookmarking a page that shows discharge will show discharge again when that bookmark is revisited.
