The recording of [this webinar](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/webinar-10-13-21/) can be viewed on the [USGS website](https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/public-webinar-modernizing-how-you-access-water-data) or on the USGS [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vqLR9ozLjE).



## Summary
This document is a how-to guide for using the USGS Water Monitoring Location Pages, which can be used to access data from thousands of water monitoring locations across the United States, US territories, and outlying areas. This document describes how to use features available in these web pages, as well as common questions users ask. Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, the example monitoring location is 01584050, which is associated with a STREAM in BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND.

## Important information
### Provisional data
New data are collected continuously. In an effort to make water data and information available to users as rapidly as possible, and until new data can be checked and reviewed and approved, the USGS releases data in near real-time in a <b>provisional status.</b> Provisional data are shown on graphs with a line color that is orange, and approved data are shown with a line color that is dark blue (these colors are subject to change). The color code legend for the graphs can be found below the graphs. When viewing the data in tabular form, the value "P" is provided for provisional data and “A” is provided for approved data in the field for "Data-value qualification code."
<i>The colors used on the graph are subject to change with the evolution of this product; we will update this guide as necessary.</i> We encourage all users to familiarize themselves with the limitations of provisional data by reading the provision data statement linked below the hydrograph.

## Interact with the hydrograph

Move your computer mouse or tap your device’s screen over top of the plot to expose the date, time, and value on the graph.
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/how-to-guide/2_interact w hydrograph.png" caption="Notice the red boxes that highlight the selected condition, which in this example is gage height, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for '[Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/01584050/)'." alt="Screenshot that highlights the selected condition on the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD." >}}
</div>

### Compare to previous data / display median
Select ‘Compare to last year’ and / or ‘Display Median’ to add historical data and statistical data, when available. Note: Median is not computed for gage height, but it is sometimes available for other parameters.
<div class="grid-row">
{{< figure src="/static/how-to-guide/3_display median.png" caption="Notice the red box is highlighting the toggle options for 'compare to last year' and 'display median,' which are located below the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for '[Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/01584050/)'." alt="Screenshot that highlights the toggles for 'compare to last year' and 'display median,' located below the hydrograph, which is on every monitoring location page, including this one for Long Green Creek at Glen Arm, MD." >}}
